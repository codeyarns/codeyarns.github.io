<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 3/4 (An entertaining comic fantasy for child
and adult alike)</p>
<p>I love discovering new movies by serendipity! 😊 I was reading
<strong>Essential C# 4.0</strong>, a book on programming recently.
Instead of the typical <em>“Hello World!”</em> example, the opening
chapter of this book used the greeting <em>“Hello. My name is Inigo
Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.”</em> It was this strange
greeting that led me to watch <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29"><strong>The
Princess Bride</strong></a>, a romance-comedy-adventure-fantasy tale. It
is based on a <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride">novel of the same
name</a> by William Goldman, which, in the movie, is read by a
grandfather to his sick grandchild.</p>
<p>Buttercup and Westley live on a farm and are in love with each other.
Westley goes away on a long journey and Buttercup soon learns that he
died on the high seas. While she is wallowing in her sorrow, Prince
Humperdinck chooses her to be his bride. While on a ride in the woods,
she is kidnapped by a gang. The gang consists of a short, clever and
devious man named Vizzini, a giant named Fezzik and a fencing master
named Inigo Montoya. They are pursued by a masked man, who defeats them
all and reveals himself as Westley to Buttercup. Westley becomes friends
with Fezzik and Inigo, the latter revealing to him that he is in pursuit
of a six-fingered man who killed his father. Prince Humperdinck tricks
them, imprisons Westley and takes away Buttercup to marry her as part of
his evil plan. It is up to the hodgepodge duo of Fezzik and Inigo to
thwart his plans.</p>
<p>The Princess Bride feels like a breath of fresh air. With a
light-hearted story that is full of comedic capers, it is refreshingly
different from today’s Disney-isque fantasies full of noisy expensive
special effects and produced with the sole intention of selling movie
paraphernalia and possible sequels. The plot intrigues, entertains and
evokes laughs with ease. The Princess Bride is an entertaining fantasy
for child and adult alike.</p>
