href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2025/01/02/young-customers-in-developing-countries-propel-a-boom-in-plastic-surgery">Young
customers in developing countries propel a boom in plastic surgery</a>:
The number of foreigners who visited Turkey for plastic surgery has
ballooned from 300K in 2013 to more than 1.5M last year. The country has
become so popular for hair transplants, which involves grafting hair
from the back of the head to the top or the front, that the national
carrier is sometimes referred to as Turkish Hairlines.</p></li>
<li><p><a
href="https://www.economist.com/asia/2025/01/02/how-14bn-indians-are-adapting-to-climate-change">How
1.4bn Indians are adapting to climate change</a>: Slums are much hotter
than richer areas, which have more shade and open space. Temperatures in
October in Dharavi, a Mumbai slum that squashes 1M people into 2.4
square km, are 5 degrees higher than in Matunga, a posher suburb next
door. The effect of humid heat on outdoor workers costs India the
equivalent of 7% of GDP each year.</p></li>
<li><p><a
href="https://www.economist.com/china/2025/01/02/china-approves-the-worlds-most-expensive-infrastructure-project">China
approves the world’s most expensive infrastructure project</a>: China
plans to build the world’s largest hydroelectric dam on the lower
reaches of Yarlung Tsangpo, which flows from Tibet into India &amp;
Bangladesh. It could generate 300B KwH of electricity annually, enough
to meet the needs of &gt;300M people and more than 3x the capacity of
the Three Gorges dam, currently the world’s largest. The cost of the
project is expected to be $137B, the most expensive infrastructure
project in the world.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3TwMX8Be7c">How to
Separate Self-Adhesive Stamps</a>: Self-adhesive stamps can’t be
separated by soaking in water. This video describes the motivation for
the creation of self-adhesive stamps (glue melting in tropical heat),
tests 3 products on how well they can separate self-adhesive stamps. I
think I will try the Pure Citrus Orange Air Freshener, since it seems
the most convenient to use.</p></li>
<li><p><a
href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/brainwash-an-executive-today/">Brainwash
An Executive Today!</a>: Yet another brilliant piece by Nikhil Suresh on
how executives grift, blatantly promote themselves, buy trash software
that make no sense to engineers and everyone ends up believing these
decisions are great and wanting to make the same (bad) decisions for
themselves.</p></li>
<li><p><a
href="https://www.cato.org/policy-analysis/why-legal-immigration-nearly-impossible">Why
Legal Immigration Is Nearly Impossible</a>: Detailed paper that
describes all the US rules, immigration/visa types and the insane amount
of process, paperwork and time to get through them. Filled with graphs
and references.</p></li>
