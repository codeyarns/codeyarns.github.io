<p>It has been 2 years to this month since one of you recommended this
book to me. (I do not remember who it was though!) And it also brings an
end to my 3-month long drought of reading.</p>
<p><a
href="http://www.amazon.com/No-God-Sight-Altaf-Tyrewala/dp/1596921943">No
God In Sight</a> is the debut novel by Altaf Tyrewala. In a short 184
pages, various characters in Mumbai talk to the reader in an upclose
<em><a href="http://that70sshow.wikia.com/wiki/The_Circle">The
Circle</a></em> style (remember That ’70s Show?). It is through these
journal-ish confessions that we learn about what is happening in their
lives right now and in the city in the bigger picture. As we move on
from one entry to the next, we discover that each character is related
to the next. As the mind goes on this time-ride, a bigger picture
emerges – of the real urban India. (Though the author and the publisher
seem to wish it is a picture of Mumbai, it is true about any Indian
city.) No one is left behind – Hindus, Muslims, doctors, terrorists,
teenagers, slum dwellers, gangsters, traders, cops, everyone turns out
to be connected to the other, though they would wish they were not.</p>
<p>The writing is realistic, the pace is unstoppable, the humour is
dark, the characters are genuine and this definitely is the noisy,
dusty, homely, quintessential Indian city familiar to anyone who has
grown up in one. Less of a city, more like a super-mutated organism that
somehow survives and thrives despite all odds against it. This is no
Naipaul-ish distant cultured India, it is gritty in-your-face In-di-ya.
The book was un-put-downable, I finished it in one sitting with no
breaks. Recommended read (4/5).</p>
