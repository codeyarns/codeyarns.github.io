<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 3/4 (If your daily life is being strung
tight by too many distractions, Focus might be a handy guide to peek
into.)</p>
<p><a href="http://focusmanifesto.com/"><strong>Focus</strong></a> is
the latest book by <strong>Leo Babauta</strong>, famous for his <a
href="http://zenhabits.net/"><strong>Zen Habits</strong></a> blog. The
book is an edited compilation of his writings at Zen Habits and <a
href="http://mnmlist.com/"><strong>Mnmlist</strong></a> on the subject
of focus. This is the latest in the series of books that seem to
recommend single-tasking in our distraction and gadget filled lives. The
theme is quite akin to <a
href="2010-08-08-the-shallows-what-the-internet-is-doing-to-our-brains.html"><strong>The
Shallows</strong></a> by Nicholas Carr, which I read recently and which
I feel is quite influential. Focus can be summed up by this Charles
Dickens quote:</p>
<blockquote>
“He did each single thing as if he did nothing else.”
</blockquote>
<p>Focus is well organized, leading from the motivation, to recognizing
the distractions, to practical ways to simplify life and finding focus.
As you might guess, there is no magic bullet. The solution lies in
recognizing the fact that with the finite time and attention we have,
there is only so much we can achieve. So, why not throw the rest
overboard and concentrate on what is attainable and brings us happiness?
This is easier said than done in our consumerist culture that emphasizes
ownership of objects and in this digital age where everyone expects one
to be available and answerable 24/7 on the Internet. The book leads the
reader gently through methods, rituals and habits that can help the
process of attaining single-tasking and mindfulness.</p>

<p>If you already read the Zen Habits and Mnmlist blogs, there might be
not much takeaway from this book. Though I must say, it is nice to read
it all as one purposeful book. The book reads gently, the chapters are
short and easy to read, think and apply. The book is freely available
and it would not be surprising if it becomes quite popular. If you find
your daily life being strung tight by too many distractions,
<strong>Focus</strong> might be a handy book to peek into.</p>
