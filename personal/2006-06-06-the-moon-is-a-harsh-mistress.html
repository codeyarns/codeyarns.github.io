<p>Clarke, Asimov and Heinlein are known as the <strong>Big
Three</strong> of science fiction. After sampling Clarke, I have started
on Heinlein with his <strong>The Moon Is A Harsh Mistress</strong>. I
was actually looking for his <a
href="2019-10-22-starship-troopers.html"><strong>Starship
Troopers</strong></a> in the library and found this instead. The story
is set in 2075 when the Moon has become a penal colony where convicts
are dumped and they grow food underground to swap it with Earth for
their other needs. The story is narrated by an one armed computer
technician named Mannie. It is about the first Lunar revolution against
Earth.</p>
<p>The descriptions of a Lunar country where humans have adjusted to the
gravity and environment is good. The formation of a secret rebel
organization is well detailed. Heinlein excels in showing the futility
of the <strong>Loonies</strong> (the Lunar residents) who many times end
up with something that they had actually started out opposing. His
subtle takes on liberty, democracy and our way of life (and the actual
futility of it all) is pretty cool. The book introduces the now popular
acronym <strong>TANSTAAFL (There Ain’t No Such Thing As A Free
Lunch)</strong>. But to be frank, I found the book quite dry and
stretching in many sections. But, it has stoked enough interest to try
his other works.</p>
