<p>I had been wowed by the movie <a
href="2006-02-18-2001-a-space-odyssey.html"><strong>2001: A Space
Odyssey</strong></a> a few years ago. It is undoubtedly one of the
greatest movie experiences and possibly the most accessible work of
Stanley Kubrick. Not having read any science-fiction in recent months, I
picked up the source of the movie, the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001:_A_Space_Odyssey_(novel)">novel
of the same name</a> written by <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_C._Clarke"><strong>Arthur C.
Clarke</strong></a>. Both the movie and the novel are based off a few
short stories of Clarke, written earlier. Both were created at the same
time, with ideas being exchanged between Clarke and Kubrick to expand on
those stories into a movie and a novel. To bring a sense of perspective,
these works were created in 1968. Armstrong and Aldrin saw the movie and
then stepped on the moon next year.</p>
<p>The novel follows the movie very closely, with four parts. In the
first part, a black monolith appears in an African valley at the
beginning of, what is now called, the Pleistocene age, the age of human
evolution. It guides a tribe of man-apes in wielding tools to magnify
their strength and thus making it easier to kill other dominant animals.
In the second part, we take a journey to the Moon where a similar
monolith has been discovered beneath a crater. When revealed and exposed
to the Sun it emits a strong radio signal across the Solar System aimed
at Japetus, a moon of Saturn. In the third part, five astronomers are on
a long journey to Saturn with the complex controls of their ship being
controlled by a computer named HAL 9000. One astronomer survives the
perils of the journey and in part four he discovers the secret of the
monolith and ends up becoming a star child.</p>
<p>I have read collections of short stories by Clarke before and here he
is no different. His writing is easy and quick to read, though the
worlds he creates are no less fantastic. He has a knack for creating
plausible artifacts and experiences that seem just a few years away from
our current time. The writing in the novel is beautiful, with some
sections a pure joy to taste and linger. Though the HAL 9000 episode is
thrilling to read, it is actually the section that is most unrelated to
the main theme of the book. Much like the movie, the weakest section is
the end which gets more nebulous the deeper you get into it. Needless to
say that Kubrick though has recreated Clarke’s vision to perfection in
the movie. It is hard not to recommend 2001: A Space Odyssey. It is a
mind-bending fantastic journey that is surprisingly easy and quick to
make right from your armchair.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/4</p>
