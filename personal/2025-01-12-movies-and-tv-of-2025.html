<h2 id="the-princess-diaries"><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Diaries_(film)">The
Princess Diaries</a></h2>
<p>A high school girl Mia (Anne Hathaway) in San Francisco discovers
that she is actually a princess and heir to the throne of a small
(fictional) European nation called Genovia. Her queen grandmother
Clarisse (Julie Andrews) arrives in SF with her bodyguard Joe to help
Anne through her high-school troubles and help her makeover into a
princess. The only reason it is even watchable are the two principal
women. Watched it on DVD.</p>
<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 3/5</p>
<h2 id="the-princess-diaries-2-royal-engagement"><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Diaries_2:_Royal_Engagement">The
Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement</a></h2>
<p>Mia’s ascension to become a queen is thwarted by an ancient Genovial
rule that the queen has to be married. Avoiding marriage to the young
and evil Nicholas (surprise, surprise Chris Pine!), Anne tries to find
love in an arranged engagement to an English Duke. Capers endure, she
grows into her royal role, finally finds true love (it was Nicholas
after all!), and also the guts to question the ancient rule and become
queen. Just another chance to enjoy how beautiful Julie Andrews and Anne
Hathaway are. Watched it on DVD.</p>
<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 4/5</p>
<h2 id="premium-rush"><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premium_Rush">Premium Rush</a></h2>
<p>There is no looking away when incredible bike messenger Wilee (Joseph
Gordon-Levitt) is racing amidst Manhattan traffic on his fixed-gear
no-brakes bike to deliver messages. The entire movie is about one
delivery of his that turns out involving Chinese gangs, a corrupt cop
and holds innocent lives in the balance. Some of the insane scenes
looked artificial, but for the most part this is an adrenaline-pumping
bike chase from start to finish. Got to wonder how they shot so many
carefully choreographed heavy-traffic scenes on so many roads in
Manhattan.</p>
<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 4/5</p>
<h2 id="phantom-thread"><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantom_Thread">Phantom
Thread</a></h2>
<p>Daniel Day-Lewis is Woodcock, a famous dressmaker in the 1950s, who
becomes enamoured with a plain-looking lady Vicky Krieps (as Alma) and
makes her his muse. Soon, his strictly controlled lifestyle grates
against her personality and his spurning leads her to sicked him with a
poisonous mushroom. She tends to him, he falls in love and they marry,
but soon his old controlling nature riles him up.</p>
<p>This movie was a bit too long (needed to finish in 2 sittings), but
the acting, lighting, period setting, gorgeous dressmaking scenes and
cinematography were incredible. Almost the entire movie has fantastic
background music that floats along with the happenings in the scene.
However, I really could not understand why the two main characters acted
the way they did, why these two differing personalities were attracted
to each other and also the 2nd poisoning made no sense at all. It is for
these reasons that I do not think I can watch it again.</p>
<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 3/5</p>
<h2 id="down-periscope"><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_Periscope">Down
Periscope</a></h2>
<p>Kelsey Grammar plays a Captain who has been assigned to lead a
rust-bucket diesel submarine in a naval exercise against the latest tech
nuclear submarines. Typical comedy with the hodge-podge submarine team
finding their groove and pulling together to pull off a trick or two to
win. Mindless fun movie.</p>
<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 3/5</p>
<h2 id="lincoln"><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln_(film)">Lincoln</a></h2>
<p>Based on the book <em>Team of Rivals</em>, this movie covers the
weeks in January 1865 when Lincoln was trying to convince the House to
pass his 13th Amendment (to abolish slavery) and wrap up the Civil War.
Directed by Steven Spielberg and Daniel Day-Lewis is totally in
character as Lincoln. We get to witness Lincoln’s intense politicking
with his cabinet and balancing the relationship with his wife and sons
leading up to the tense count of votes in the House. Daniel’s acting and
the period setup totally immerse the viewer in the America of 1865. My
only complaint is that this movie suffers from the now-common problem of
a dark/black/blue color palette that is devoid of all the other
colors.</p>
<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 4/5</p>
<h2 id="celeste--jesse-forever"><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celeste_and_Jesse_Forever">Celeste
&amp; Jesse Forever</a></h2>
<p>Rashida Jones and Andy Samberg play a goofy young married couple who
have been together since high school but are going through a divorce at
the start of the movie. The movie deals their journey of realization
that they really are not meant for each other, but are still the best
friends for each other and need to remain that way. The journey is
especially hard on Celeste (Rashida) who still believed that immature
Andy would eventually return back to her, but is forced to realize that
he is not really suitable for her. Rashida Jones is also the co-writer
and apparently the plot is based personal experiences of her, the
co-writer Will McCormack and friends. Rashida’s acting is great, it is
Andy who probably comes off a bit too goofish for this serious role. The
city of Los Angeles plays the third wheel, shot beautifully and the
quirks of the people who inhabit it provide a lot of the laughs.</p>
<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 4/5</p>
<h2 id="magic-mike"><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Mike">Magic Mike</a></h2>
<p>Channing Tatum and Matthew McConaughey bring incredible energy to
their roles as male strippers. Despite that, there is only so much
stripping I can handle in a movie. But, the personal aspirations and
lives of the characters are actually far more interesting. I hope they
built more on that in the second movie.</p>
<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 3/5</p>
<h2 id="unfaithful"><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unfaithful_(2002_film)">Unfaithful</a></h2>
<p>Suburban mom/wife Diane Lane falls for a younger French guy in the
city in this erotic thriller. Indecent Proposal director Adrian Lyne is
able to make every scene look gorgeous, especially upscale New York and
NYC and the story unrolls like a slow car crash that you cannot look
away from. Husband Richard Gere finds out eventually and his meeting the
fling takes a fatal turn. Diane Lane looks and acts fantastic and
carries the entire movie herself, while Richard Gere looks like wrong
casting whenever his character needs to cry or be angry. Also, the movie
ending with no consequences for the murderer is unsettling.</p>
<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 4/5</p>
<h2 id="hope-springs"><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hope_Springs_(2012_film)">Hope
Springs</a></h2>
<p>Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones play empty nesters who have been
married for 31 years and live like roommates now. Meryl wants to get the
romance back in the relationship and she persuades the hubby to attend
an intense couples therapy together, conducted by Steve Carell in a
touristy Maine town. It is fantastic to watch this couple, Meryl with
the expressions of a young girl still in love and Jones as a
weather-beaten tax accountant. The rest of the plot is super weak
though, no idea why Steve Carell was chosen, nor is it obvious how this
generic counseling session is so magical.</p>
<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 3/5</p>
<h2 id="side-effects"><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_Effects_(2013_film)">Side
Effects</a></h2>
<p>Jude Law is a psychiatrist treating a depressed and suicidal Rooney
Mara with a heavily-advertized new medication when she kills her husband
Channing Tatum its influence. Law’s practice and his relationship are
destroyed in the wake of Rooney’s legal case before he discovers
something sinister with her previous psychiatrist Catherine Zeta-Jones.
Just as I was dreading having to sit through the realistically portrayed
depressed life of Rooney, the movie takes a fantastic turn into the
mystery genre. And after that it becomes an edge-of-the-seat thriller as
you root for Law to make the impossible happen - reveal the real crime
and get his life back. Jude Law is fantastic as usual, sucking you into
every scene he is in and so is a middle-aged Catherine Zeta-Jones.
Rooney is also incredible, being a chameleon portraying the life of her
character. The movie plays at multiple levels: the ills of the US pharma
industry, the over-prescribing of drugs by doctors, the complicated life
of psychiatrists, the life of depression and of course the mystery.
There is simply no wrong beat in this movie, it is rivetting as to be
expected by director Steven Soderbergh.</p>
<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 5/5</p>
<h2 id="decision-to-leave"><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_to_Leave">Decision to
Leave</a></h2>
<p>Korean neo-noir where a detective investigating a man’s suicide falls
in love with the suspect, the man’s beautiful widow. The acting is top
notch, cinematography is lush and gorgeous, the tone is insomniac and
dreamy and the plot makes you wonder “Did she do it?” many times. The
plot meanders a lot though and gets confusing, which I didn’t like. The
movie is marked by a tragic but poetic ending.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 3/5</p>
<h2 id="conclave"><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conclave_(film)">Conclave</a></h2>
<p>Ralph Fiennes and a stellar cast of characters are involved in the
drama of choosing a new pope following their secretive procedures behind
closed doors. There are delicious twists and surprises and it is all
highly riveting and entertaining.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/5</p>
<h2 id="jurassic-world-dominion"><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_World_Dominion">Jurassic
World: Dominion</a></h2>
<p>There are more dinosaurs, chases through cities, a Tim Cook-lookalike
villain breeding yet another new dinosaur, climate change, giant
insects, Blue and the mysterious child and the original cast reunites.
Watchable, but lacklustre concluding saga to the Jurassic World
series.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 3/5</p>
<h2 id="elio"><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elio_(film)">Elio</a></h2>
<p>Kicked off summer with my son by catching this on opening day at the
neighborhood theater. It felt like a slightly watered down Pixar movie,
with laughs, lessons and a few misty-eyed scenes for both kid and adult.
The problem with Elio is that it is not memorable, the protagonist kid
and the aliens he befriends are all forgettable. The movie addresses the
problem of loneliness of the orphaned kid living with his aunt and I
felt most drawn to it at the start of the movie when it involved the
adult world. Once it went to space, it just diluted down as an
experience for me.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 3/5</p>
<h2 id="the-quatermass-xperiment"><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Quatermass_Xperiment">The
Quatermass Xperiment</a></h2>
<p>A sci-fi B&amp;W B-movie from 1955 that I found to be surprisingly
intriguing and entertaining. The movie begins with the rocket devised by
Quatermass crash landing with a lone survivor of the 3 astronauts. The
audience is kept busy with the investigations of how the other 2 might
have disappeared, while the surviving astronaut escapes from the
hospital and seems to be on the rampage. What seems to have happened is
that some alien energy mass has invaded the astronaut’s body and is now
trying to grow and reproduce. There are many cute B&amp;W-timey horror
set pieces, there is no insult to our intelligence and a great climactic
set piece at Westminister Abbey. The movie is eminently watchable and it
only feels dated during the few moments they need to show the
monster.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/5</p>
<h2 id="monkey-man"><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_Man_(film)">Monkey
Man</a></h2>
<p>Dev Patel directs and acts in this revenge action movie. Our hero
Bobby is plotting his revenge against the cop and the Godman, who in his
childhood, brutally killed his mom and set fire to their home in a bid
to capture real estate. At night, he gets punched up in illegal fighting
rings and during the day he is working his way up at the secretive Kings
club, which the cop and Godman patronize. His first attempt to kill them
goes horribly wrong and he is revived by a group of hijras, whose spirit
enables him to return and go through Kings floor-by-floor exacting
cinematic brutal bloody revenge in John Wicks style. The setting is
similar to Slumdog Millionaire and the plot puts his Hanuman-like
character amidst rising right-wing Hindu nationalism and characters who
echo those from Ramayana. There is not a single boring moment and it is
rivetting, but I am not a fan of such brutal violence on screen.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 3/5</p>
<h2 id="f1"><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_(film)">F1</a></h2>
<p>Brad Pitt stars as an aged racecar driver <em>Sonny Hayes</em> who
returns to F1 to help a struggling team and a promising young driver
Joshua Pearce. Officially blessed by F1, the movie is a shiny fun
edutainment vehicle for the racing series. F1 sponsor brands festoon
every inch of every visible surface and quite obviously the movie is
doing a tourism infomercial for Abu Dhabi in its final race. Despite
these obligations, director Joseph Kosinski keeps the plot focused on
the 2 drivers, APXGP team owner, the lone female technical director and
the pit crew. Even during the races, which are spread over 9 tracks, we
never get to see the other racer faces and are focused on the main
characters. I have never sat through a F1 race, so it was interesting to
see some strategies with tires and 2 drivers, vehicles changes, all
sorts of arcane realtime changes to the race if there are accidents,
though it is not clear if those are all permitted in a real race. The
movie is heavily cliched (does the leading man have to sleep with the
only female brain on screen?), however it is thrilling and entertaining.
I loved the movie score by Hans Zimmer too.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/5</p>
<h2 id="rumble-in-the-bronx"><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumble_in_the_Bronx">Rumble in the
Bronx</a></h2>
<p>Jackie Chan arrives in NYC in this movie to fight off the baddies who
trouble his uncle’s grocery store. There are some expensive and
elaborate set pieces, but not enough of a funny plot, or Jackie’s antics
or funny lines (like in Rush Hour) to make this worth a repeat
watch.</p>
<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 3/5</p>
<h2 id="patton"><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patton_(film)">Patton</a></h2>
<p>Starting from his epic opening lines in front of a giant US flag to
the end credits, I felt like I was actually watching Patton, and not
George C. Scott <em>playing</em> the general. Patton was a highly
successful general in WW2 in North Africa and the final push into
Germany. This movie captures his mercurial nature, leadership style,
interactions and friendships with other generals and war strategy. The
writing and the 3-act plot by Francis Ford Coppola is fantastic, the
vision and direction by Franklin Schaffner to show us the scale of the
war exploits across multiple war locations is incredible and George C.
Scott just embodies the general fully too. This movie is a feast!</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 5/5</p>
<h2 id="mississippi-burning"><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_Burning">Mississippi
Burning</a></h2>
<p>Loosely based on the killing of civil rights activists in 1964, this
movie is a whodunit set in Mississippi filled with segregation and the
KKK. Great casting and acting by Gene Hackman, William Dafoe and
everybody else. The shocking historical setting and plot is intriguing
and the cinematography is brilliant. If the movie had not focused so
much on the white characters while putting the victimized Black people
in the background, it would have been even better.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/5</p>
<h2 id="monsoon-wedding"><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsoon_Wedding">Monsoon
Wedding</a></h2>
<p>An unintended coincidence with the recent NYC election, I re-watched
Mira Nair’s famous movie again. It was a delight to see the 2000-era
Delhi and the delightful cast of actors, especially Naseeruddin Shah,
Shefali Shah and Lillete Dubey. The plot is funny, intriguing and
satisfying, especially the love between Dubey and Alice. The movie hits
all the right spots.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/5</p>
<h2 id="office-space"><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Space">Office Space</a></h2>
<p>Another guilty pleasure was watching this gem of a satire again. How
well matched it is even today! The characters, their iconic dialogues
(“MmmmOK”) and those TPS reports are all classic.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/5</p>
<h2 id="young-sheldon-season-1"><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Sheldon">Young Sheldon (Season
1)</a></h2>
<p>I love <em>The Big Bang Theory</em> and was surprised to learn there
is a TV series centered on Sheldon’s childhood airing since 2017! The
casting of the 3 kids is perfect, especially <em>Iain Armitage</em> as
Sheldon is a shocking mirror image of his older self. I found the
characters of his mother, dad and grandmother to be just OK. Season 1
has 22 episodes, so can be a great time waster. I quite enjoyed the
first half of the season which just focused on Sheldon. The latter half
focuses on the romantic relationship of <em>Meemaw</em> (his
grandmother) and I had no interest in that. If her relationship
continues to take the center stage, I might not watch the following
seasons.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 3/5</p>
<h2 id="bridge-of-spies"><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_of_Spies_(film)">Bridge of
Spies</a></h2>
<p>Apparently based on some true events, this is a story of the
negotiations of a swap of Cold War era spies between US and Russia.
Directed by Steven Spielberg, the talented insurance lawyer who does the
negotiations with Russia and East Germany is Tom Hanks. First a Russian
spy is caught in the US and Tom Hanks is chosen to be the defense lawyer
in a cuckoo court trial. Soon a US spy plane is shot and the pilot is
captured by the Russians. And also a US student from West Germany is
captured by East Germany after they put up the Berlin Wall. The CIA
pressures Tom Hanks to swap the Russian spy for the US pilot, but Hanks
wants to also secure the release of the US student from East Germany in
the same exchange. The Cold War settings are intriguing to watch, the
dialogues and acting are great. However, the script does not really show
how or why Hanks changed the minds of the Russians and East Germans on
the swap. Another problem is that this movie follows the current plague
of movies looking dull, dark and black, instead of being colorful.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 3/5</p>
<h2 id="ben-hur"><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben-Hur_(1959_film)">Ben-Hur</a></h2>
<p>This is a classic film that had been on my list for decades now! It
seems to be based on a story and hero set during the birth and rise of
Jesus Christ (who is always shown from the back, without revealing his
face). Judah Ben-Hur is the Jewish prince of Judea, which the new Roman
tribune Messala wants to control. Turns out that Judah and Messala had
been childhood friends. But that turns to hatred and vengeance when
Judah refuses to turn on his people and Messala sends him to the galleys
and his mom and sister to the dungeons. By a stroke of luck, Judah saves
the life of a Roman naval commander and rises to be a champion
charioteer in Rome. He returns back to Judea to learn that his mom and
sister have died and extracts revenge on Messala by defeating him in a
fantastic chariot race. He later discovers that his family is alive, but
living in a leper colony. Their leprosy is cured and the family is back
together when their life intersects with the sermons of Jesus and his
crucification.</p>
<p>Though it ran to a massive 3.5 hours, I never felt the movie was too
slow in any place. The plot keeps the focus on a small number of primary
characters and these actors are all fantastic: Charlton Heston as Judah
and Jack Hawkins as Messala. The movie has incredibly massive sets that
are amazing to experience, to this day. Especially the chariot race
arena is a sight to behold and no CGI can outshine it. This is truly the
way a big budget movie should be made, great direction, cinematography,
acting and an epic story.</p>
