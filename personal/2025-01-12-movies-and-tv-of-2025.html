<h3 id="the-princess-diaries"><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Diaries_(film)">The
Princess Diaries</a></h3>
<p>A high school girl Mia (Anne Hathaway) in San Francisco discovers
that she is actually a princess and heir to the throne of a small
(fictional) European nation called Genovia. Her queen grandmother
Clarisse (Julie Andrews) arrives in SF with her bodyguard Joe to help
Anne through her high-school troubles and help her makeover into a
princess. The only reason it is even watchable are the two principal
women. Watched it on DVD.</p>
<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 3/5</p>
<h3 id="the-princess-diaries-2-royal-engagement"><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Diaries_2:_Royal_Engagement">The
Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement</a></h3>
<p>Mia’s ascension to become a queen is thwarted by an ancient Genovial
rule that the queen has to be married. Avoiding marriage to the young
and evil Nicholas (surprise, surprise Chris Pine!), Anne tries to find
love in an arranged engagement to an English Duke. Capers endure, she
grows into her royal role, finally finds true love (it was Nicholas
after all!), and also the guts to question the ancient rule and become
queen. Just another chance to enjoy how beautiful Julie Andrews and Anne
Hathaway are. Watched it on DVD.</p>
<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 4/5</p>
<h2 id="premium-rush"><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premium_Rush">Premium Rush</a></h2>
<p>There is no looking away when incredible bike messenger Wilee (Joseph
Gordon-Levitt) is racing amidst Manhattan traffic on his fixed-gear
no-brakes bike to deliver messages. The entire movie is about one
delivery of his that turns out involving Chinese gangs, a corrupt cop
and holds innocent lives in the balance. Some of the insane scenes
looked artificial, but for the most part this is an adrenaline-pumping
bike chase from start to finish. Got to wonder how they shot so many
carefully choreographed heavy-traffic scenes on so many roads in
Manhattan.</p>
<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 4/5</p>
