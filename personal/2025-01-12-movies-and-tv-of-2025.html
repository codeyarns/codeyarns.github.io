<h2 id="the-princess-diaries"><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Diaries_(film)">The
Princess Diaries</a></h2>
<p>A high school girl Mia (Anne Hathaway) in San Francisco discovers
that she is actually a princess and heir to the throne of a small
(fictional) European nation called Genovia. Her queen grandmother
Clarisse (Julie Andrews) arrives in SF with her bodyguard Joe to help
Anne through her high-school troubles and help her makeover into a
princess. The only reason it is even watchable are the two principal
women. Watched it on DVD.</p>
<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 3/5</p>
<h2 id="the-princess-diaries-2-royal-engagement"><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Diaries_2:_Royal_Engagement">The
Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement</a></h2>
<p>Mia‚Äôs ascension to become a queen is thwarted by an ancient Genovial
rule that the queen has to be married. Avoiding marriage to the young
and evil Nicholas (surprise, surprise Chris Pine!), Anne tries to find
love in an arranged engagement to an English Duke. Capers endure, she
grows into her royal role, finally finds true love (it was Nicholas
after all!), and also the guts to question the ancient rule and become
queen. Just another chance to enjoy how beautiful Julie Andrews and Anne
Hathaway are. Watched it on DVD.</p>
<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 4/5</p>
<h2 id="premium-rush"><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premium_Rush">Premium Rush</a></h2>
<p>There is no looking away when incredible bike messenger Wilee (Joseph
Gordon-Levitt) is racing amidst Manhattan traffic on his fixed-gear
no-brakes bike to deliver messages. The entire movie is about one
delivery of his that turns out involving Chinese gangs, a corrupt cop
and holds innocent lives in the balance. Some of the insane scenes
looked artificial, but for the most part this is an adrenaline-pumping
bike chase from start to finish. Got to wonder how they shot so many
carefully choreographed heavy-traffic scenes on so many roads in
Manhattan.</p>
<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 4/5</p>
<h2 id="phantom-thread"><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantom_Thread">Phantom
Thread</a></h2>
<p>Daniel Day-Lewis is Woodcock, a famous dressmaker in the 1950s, who
becomes enamoured with a plain-looking lady Vicky Krieps (as Alma) and
makes her his muse. Soon, his strictly controlled lifestyle grates
against her personality and his spurning leads her to sicked him with a
poisonous mushroom. She tends to him, he falls in love and they marry,
but soon his old controlling nature riles him up.</p>
<p>This movie was a bit too long (needed to finish in 2 sittings), but
the acting, lighting, period setting, gorgeous dressmaking scenes and
cinematography were incredible. Almost the entire movie has fantastic
background music that floats along with the happenings in the scene.
However, I really could not understand why the two main characters acted
the way they did, why these two differing personalities were attracted
to each other and also the 2nd poisoning made no sense at all. It is for
these reasons that I do not think I can watch it again.</p>
<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 3/5</p>
<h2 id="down-periscope"><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_Periscope">Down
Periscope</a></h2>
<p>Kelsey Grammar plays a Captain who has been assigned to lead a
rust-bucket diesel submarine in a naval exercise against the latest tech
nuclear submarines. Typical comedy with the hodge-podge submarine team
finding their groove and pulling together to pull off a trick or two to
win. Mindless fun movie.</p>
<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 3/5</p>
<h2 id="lincoln"><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln_(film)">Lincoln</a></h2>
<p>Based on the book <em>Team of Rivals</em>, this movie covers the
weeks in January 1865 when Lincoln was trying to convince the House to
pass his 13th Amendment (to abolish slavery) and wrap up the Civil War.
Directed by Steven Spielberg and Daniel Day-Lewis is totally in
character as Lincoln. We get to witness Lincoln‚Äôs intense politicking
with his cabinet and balancing the relationship with his wife and sons
leading up to the tense count of votes in the House. Daniel‚Äôs acting and
the period setup totally immerse the viewer in the America of 1865. My
only complaint is that this movie suffers from the now-common problem of
a dark/black/blue color palette that is devoid of all the other
colors.</p>
<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 4/5</p>
<h2 id="celeste--jesse-forever"><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celeste_and_Jesse_Forever">Celeste
&amp; Jesse Forever</a></h2>
<p>Rashida Jones and Andy Samberg play a goofy young married couple who
have been together since high school but are going through a divorce at
the start of the movie. The movie deals their journey of realization
that they really are not meant for each other, but are still the best
friends for each other and need to remain that way. The journey is
especially hard on Celeste (Rashida) who still believed that immature
Andy would eventually return back to her, but is forced to realize that
he is not really suitable for her. Rashida Jones is also the co-writer
and apparently the plot is based personal experiences of her, the
co-writer Will McCormack and friends. Rashida‚Äôs acting is great, it is
Andy who probably comes off a bit too goofish for this serious role. The
city of Los Angeles plays the third wheel, shot beautifully and the
quirks of the people who inhabit it provide a lot of the laughs.</p>
<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 4/5</p>
<h2 id="magic-mike"><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Mike">Magic Mike</a></h2>
<p>Channing Tatum and Matthew McConaughey bring incredible energy to
their roles as male strippers. Despite that, there is only so much
stripping I can handle in a movie. But, the personal aspirations and
lives of the characters are actually far more interesting. I hope they
built more on that in the second movie.</p>
<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 3/5</p>
