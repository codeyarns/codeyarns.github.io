<p><strong>Our Moon</strong> begins in spectacular fashion, describing
the 1943 <em>Battle of Tarawa</em>, where the US suffered losses from
trapped landing craft due to miscalculation of high tides. Starting from
there <strong>Rebecca Boyle</strong> tries to cover everything about our
beloved Moon, its origins, influence on our planet and our daily lives
and on human society and history.</p>
<p>I was quite surprised to learn that scientists are still not able to
decide if the moon was formed by giant impact (<em>Giant Impact
Hypothesis</em>) or created together with the Earth. Though the moon
appears so small in the night sky, its influence on Earth is huge. Earth
and moon rotate around their shared barycenter. Moon’s gravitational
pull has been causing tides, which have been slowing down Earth’s
rotation for a long time. For example, back in the early era of fish
evolution, Earth had a short 21 hour day. And the moon has kept Earth’s
axial tilt stable without getting affected by Jupiter’s giant pull.</p>
<p>The moon might also have played a minor role in early evolution
through life in tide pools and aiding fish to move to the land. There
are also undoubtedly many creatures on land and in water that use the
moon to decide on feeding, mating, spawning. The problem though is that
Rebecca tries to make the case that the moon is <em>the</em> reason for
these phenomenon and almost says that these would not have happened
without the moon, which I felt was weak.</p>
<p>Sadly for me, this book spends a majority of its pages on the social
and historical influence of the moon. Ungodly amounts of ink have been
spilt on some ancient moon calendar in <em>warren field pits</em> in
Britain, Nebra sky disk and the moon appearing in Mesopotamia and
Babylon. She also spends way too much time on Ptolemy’s geocentric world
and Copernicus’s helio-centric world.</p>
<p>Though Rebecca’s writing has an inspiring quality, I ended up not
liking the book since it is so weak on the science. Missing are all the
scientific facts, observations, discoveries and probes to the moon.
Though the moon landing is covered briefly, I felt the technological
lead up to that event should have been covered in intimate detail. In
place of all this, we are hammered with hundreds of pages of
<em>maybe</em> theories, extreme lengths of descriptions of a few
ancient artifacts and insanely long travelogues of the author in Britain
to visit some people who are preserving ancient moon calendars. In
conclusion, this book ended up feeling less of a science book, and more
of a social sciences book.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 3/5</p>
