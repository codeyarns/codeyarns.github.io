<p>Set in Japan around the turbulent World War II period, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoirs_of_a_Geisha_%28film%29"><strong>Memoirs of a Geisha</strong></a> is the story of a <em>geisha</em> named <strong>Sayuri</strong> (Zhang Ziyi). Sold off by her poor parents to an <em>okiya</em> (geisha house), she is put into training to become a geisha. When she gets on the wrong side of <strong>Hatsumomo</strong> (Gong Li), the geisha of the okiya, she is made the servant of the house. In the midst of her troubles, she meets a man called the <strong>Chairman</strong> (Ken Watanabe), who comforts her. Luck changes for Sayuri when <strong>Mameha</strong> (Michelle Yeoh), a bitter rival of Hatsumomo, buys her off and trains her as a geisha. Sayuri learns well and debuts as a successful geisha. Just when her dreams are coming true, Japan gets embroiled in World War II and she is sent to a distant rural province. When she returns back after the war, Japan has changed. The cities are filled with American soldiers, businessmen and geisha has turned into a lecherous word. Sayuri tries to gain a footing in this world while looking to win the heart of her Chairman.</p>
<p>Directed by <strong>Rob Marshall</strong>, this movie is based on a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoirs_of_a_Geisha">book of the same name</a>. Though I had seen Japanese women dressed as geisha during my visit to Kyoto, I must admit that I was confused about their profession and role in Japanese society. The movie clears the air, portraying them as they were in traditional Japanese culture: female entertainers. The movie draws on the fantastic Asian female trio: <strong>Zhang Ziyi</strong>, <strong>Gong Li</strong> and <strong>Michelle Yeoh</strong>, each owning every one of their scenes. The same goes for the males, with riveting performances by both <strong>Ken Watanabe</strong> and <strong>Koji Yakusho</strong>. The most striking feature of the movie is undoubtedly its cinematography. There are some unforgettably stunning scenes here, like young Sayuri running through a temple gateway and the climactic scene set in a Japanese garden in spring bloom. The scenes are well complemented by a moving score by <strong>John Williams</strong>. There are some melancholic cello pieces played by <strong>Yo Yo Ma</strong> that should not be missed. On the downside, the movie is quite long, feeling much like an old Bollywood movie. Memoirs of a Geisha takes the viewer back to a magical place and time in Japan and this experience is not to be missed!</p>
