]</p>
<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 2/4 (Average movie)</p>
<p>This week I saw the animated movie <a
href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0892782/">Monsters vs. Aliens</a>, the
sole reason to see it being that it was showing in <em><a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolby_3D">Dolby 3D</a></em> at
certain theatres. This was the first time I was watching a movie in 3D
(not just Dolby 3D, in <em>any</em> 3D). I had to wear the Dolby 3D
glasses that are handed out at the theatre. These dark colored glasses
have a red tinge in one eye and a green in the other. Without these
glasses, the movie looks like the superposition of 2 images with a tiny
shift.</p>
<p>3D screening technology is spreading and movie studios are pushing it
to entice more moviegoers to theatres and to shell out more from them
for tickets. So, how good is the 3D? Let me tell you, 3D is exciting for
exactly <em>5 minutes</em>! After that I was wishing I had seen the
movie in normal 2D glory. The color richness is just not there,
everything is dull, as if under cloud cover. Brightness is way lesser,
thus straining the eyes. And the 3D effects are plain cheesy and
useless. In an attempt to show off the 3D, the director tends to put in
unnecessary scenes with characters and objects either racing towards or
away from the viewer. The whole 3D menagerie is an utter waste, which
ends up degrading the movie experience a lot. I know for a fact that I
would have enjoyed the movie had I seen it in 2D.</p>
<p>That was the 3D, how is <em>this</em> movie? Do not be fooled by the
title of this movie produced by Dreamworks. It neither has the funny
monsters from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0198781/">Monsters,
Inc.</a> (the Pixar movie) nor the scary aliens from the <a
href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078748/">Alien</a> movie series.
Instead, the monsters here are a blob (yes siree!) named
<em>B.O.B.</em>, a human-cockroach mad scientist named
<em>Dr. Cockroach</em>, a fish-ape creature named <em>The Missing
Link</em> (no, really!) and <em>Insectosaurus</em>, a skyscraper-tall
mutated grub. A new monster who joins this gang is <em>Ginormica</em>
(Reese Whitherspoon), a bride who grows into a giant on her wedding day.
Once these silly monsters are introduced they are jobless and bored, so
throw in a crazy alien. Despite his higher intellect and superior
technology, the alien is enormously stupid. End with a fight between the
monsters and (the one) alien for the sake of planet Earth.</p>
<p>I really wonder how this movie got bankrolled! The monsters are so
goddamn one-dimensional characters, pulled from B-grade sci-fi movies of
yesteryears. The idea is a nice one, but they just do not stand up to
the clean 3D animated treatment. To be honest, the movie is somewhat
funny. But, the jokes are all forgettable and childish, you are
guaranteed not to remember a single thing after you walk out. This movie
can be avoided.</p>
