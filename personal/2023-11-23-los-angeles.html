<h1 class="title">Los Angeles</h1>

<p>We did a road trip to <strong>Los Angeles</strong> during the Thanksgiving week. As always with such big cities, there are lots to see and we were able to only see a few places among them.</p>
<h2 id="stay">Stay</h2>
<ul>
<li>We had booked an Airbnb place in Pasadena that was a home with 2 bedrooms and a bathroom. We loved the quaint Southern California architecture of this old home and its front yard.</li>
<li>The place had its own parking inside the lot. This turned out to be an important factor since it seemed like there were many Airbnb places which did not have their inner parking and expected the visitor to compete for street parking and pay for it to the city of Pasadena.</li>
<li>This was near the Harambee Ministries and the whole neighborhood was like the suburbs, quiet and peaceful. After hearing a lot about crime and homelessness in LA, I was glad that we could avoid it, especially when traveling with family.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="drive">Drive</h2>
<ul>
<li>The route I took from Fremont was: 101 South to Gilroy, 152 to Los Banos, I5 down through Central Valley and then through the mountains around LA into the city.</li>
<li>The traffic inside LA county to drive to various places can be a bit much. Also the driving is difficult because the route requires you to do many exits and switches to different freeways and highways.</li>
<li>We took breaks for food near Los Banos at the North and near Bakersfield in the South, before entering the mountains surrounding LA.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="natural-history-museum-of-los-angeles-county"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_History_Museum_of_Los_Angeles_County">Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>This is the museum which is featured in the movie One Night at the Museum.</li>
<li>This is a fantastic old and grand building, maintained very well. Prepare to be awed when you walk in to the main atrium and witness the T-Rex and triceratops skeletons on display under a grand ceiling. Similarly there is a second atrium whose dome ceiling is extremely beautiful.</li>
<li>Must see are the dinosaur hall, the mammals hall, the African mammals and the birds.</li>
<li>This turned out to be a great place for our kids. They loved seeing the dinosaur skeletons, mammal skeletons and playing in the kids area in the 2nd floor. There is also an exterior kids play area near the cafe, which I am sure they would have enjoyed if we had had the time.</li>
<li>There is a cafe at the museum that serves simple sandwiches and pizzas. Note that it gets super crowded at 12 and you will waste a lot of time to order and get your order. Better plan to either have an early lunch at 11 or later at 1.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="warner-brothers-studio-tour-hollywood"><a href="https://www.wbstudiotour.com/">Warner Brothers Studio Tour Hollywood</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>We had booked ahead for this tour to understand how movies and TV series are made in Hollywood.</li>
<li>They take you around in a golf cart to exterior sets and then the sound stages (big sheds) and the guide explains how everything is used in making movies and TV series.</li>
<li>We also got to visit the real set of a TV series which is being filmed right now. Just the set, we did not see any camera equipment or the crew.</li>
<li>At the end there is an interactive center where you get to see and take photos with the Friends Cafe, the Friends set, the Big Bang Theory set and other interactive elements. They also have virtual 3D acting for the kids, but the recordings can be quite expensive ($100+).</li>
<li>At the end they leave you back at the Studio Tour building where there are more rooms with costumes, artwork and installations of the movies and TV series.</li>
<li>Overall, I think I would have liked it if they had shown a real shooting in progress, more real sets (not just one). I found it frustrating when an entire hour is spent stopping outside the sound stage buildings and being told what had been shot inside - what is the point?</li>
<li>I think this tour is expensive and only worth it for real fans of these movies and TV series.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="hollywood-boulevard">Hollywood Boulevard</h2>
<ul>
<li>In the morning, we made a first stop at the Hollywood Sign (described previously <a href="2023-03-30-disneyland.html">here</a>) and later drove to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_Boulevard">Hollywood Boulevard</a>.</li>
<li>Parking can be a problem here, so I had looked up parking places near the TCL Chinese Theater on SpotAngels and parked in one of those lots. $20 for the whole day.</li>
<li>The Boulevard has important Hollywood buildings and the Hollywood Walk of Fame - the stars in the pavement all along this street on both sides.</li>
<li>Some important buildings include the Dolby Theater and TCL Chinese Theater.</li>
<li>It also fun to walk along spotting the stars of your favorite actors and directors.</li>
<li>There are lots of souvenir shops all along this road, for buying those LA/Hollywood trinkets for folks.</li>
<li>Expect to see a small number of homeless, mentally disturbed or drugged people on the pavement.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="griffith-observatory"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griffith_Observatory">Griffith Observatory</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>We wanted to visit this fantastic observatory on top of the hills in Griffith Park, watch a movie in its theater and see the views of LA downtown from there.</li>
<li>However, there was simply to parking, even on a Tuesday afternoon! We had to just drive back.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="baps-shri-swaminarayan-mandir"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAPS_Shri_Swaminarayan_Mandir_Chino_Hills">BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Instead of Griffith Observatory, we drove to this beautiful temple out in the city of Chino Hills. The traffic was tedious both ways.</li>
<li>The temple campus and the temple itself looks beautiful from outside. A great place to take photos and sit outside.</li>
<li>The inside of the temple is shockingly small, has too many pillars blocking any chance of enjoying the interior and there is simply to no space for a group of devotees to sit or stand together. Shockingly different from the temple interior design in South Indian temples.</li>
</ul>
