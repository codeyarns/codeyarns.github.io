<p>We did a road trip to <strong>Los Angeles</strong> during the
Thanksgiving week. As always with such big cities, there are lots to see
and we were able to only see a few places among them.</p>
<h2 id="stay">Stay</h2>
<ul>
<li>We had booked an Airbnb place in Pasadena that was a home with 2
bedrooms and a bathroom. We loved the quaint Southern California
architecture of this old home and its front yard.</li>
<li>The place had its own parking inside the lot. This turned out to be
an important factor since it seemed like there were many Airbnb places
which did not have their inner parking and expected the visitor to
compete for street parking and pay for it to the city of Pasadena.</li>
<li>This was near the Harambee Ministries and the whole neighborhood was
like the suburbs, quiet and peaceful. After hearing a lot about crime
and homelessness in LA, I was glad that we could avoid it, especially
when traveling with family.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="drive">Drive</h2>
<ul>
<li>The route I took from Fremont was: 101 South to Gilroy, 152 to Los
Banos, I5 down through Central Valley and then through the mountains
around LA into the city.</li>
<li>The traffic inside LA county to drive to various places can be a bit
much. Also the driving is difficult because the route requires you to do
many exits and switches to different freeways and highways.</li>
<li>We took breaks for food near Los Banos at the North and near
Bakersfield in the South, before entering the mountains surrounding
LA.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="natural-history-museum-of-los-angeles-county"><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_History_Museum_of_Los_Angeles_County">Natural
History Museum of Los Angeles County</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>This is the museum which is featured in the movie One Night at the
Museum.</li>
<li>This is a fantastic old and grand building, maintained very well.
Prepare to be awed when you walk in to the main atrium and witness the
T-Rex and triceratops skeletons on display under a grand ceiling.
Similarly there is a second atrium whose dome ceiling is extremely
beautiful.</li>
<li>Must see are the dinosaur hall, the mammals hall, the African
mammals and the birds.</li>
<li>This turned out to be a great place for our kids. They loved seeing
the dinosaur skeletons, mammal skeletons and playing in the kids area in
the 2nd floor. There is also an exterior kids play area near the cafe,
which I am sure they would have enjoyed if we had had the time.</li>
<li>There is a cafe at the museum that serves simple sandwiches and
pizzas. Note that it gets super crowded at 12 and you will waste a lot
of time to order and get your order. Better plan to either have an early
lunch at 11 or later at 1.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="warner-brothers-studio-tour-hollywood"><a
href="https://www.wbstudiotour.com/">Warner Brothers Studio Tour
Hollywood</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>We had booked ahead for this tour to understand how movies and TV
series are made in Hollywood.</li>
<li>They take you around in a golf cart to exterior sets and then the
sound stages (big sheds) and the guide explains how everything is used
in making movies and TV series.</li>
<li>We also got to visit the real set of a TV series which is being
filmed right now. Just the set, we did not see any camera equipment or
the crew.</li>
<li>At the end there is an interactive center where you get to see and
take photos with the Friends Cafe, the Friends set, the Big Bang Theory
set and other interactive elements. They also have virtual 3D acting for
the kids, but the recordings can be quite expensive ($100+).</li>
<li>At the end they leave you back at the Studio Tour building where
there are more rooms with costumes, artwork and installations of the
movies and TV series.</li>
<li>Overall, I think I would have liked it if they had shown a real
shooting in progress, more real sets (not just one). I found it
frustrating when an entire hour is spent stopping outside the sound
stage buildings and being told what had been shot inside - what is the
point?</li>
<li>I think this tour is expensive and only worth it for real fans of
these movies and TV series.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="hollywood-boulevard">Hollywood Boulevard</h2>
<ul>
<li>In the morning, we made a first stop at the Hollywood Sign
(described previously <a href="2023-03-30-disneyland.html">here</a>) and
later drove to <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_Boulevard">Hollywood
Boulevard</a>.</li>
<li>Parking can be a problem here, so I had looked up parking places
near the TCL Chinese Theater on SpotAngels and parked in one of those
lots. $20 for the whole day.</li>
<li>The Boulevard has important Hollywood buildings and the Hollywood
Walk of Fame - the stars in the pavement all along this street on both
sides.</li>
<li>Some important buildings include the Dolby Theater and TCL Chinese
Theater.</li>
<li>It also fun to walk along spotting the stars of your favorite actors
and directors.</li>
<li>There are lots of souvenir shops all along this road, for buying
those LA/Hollywood trinkets for folks.</li>
<li>Expect to see a small number of homeless, mentally disturbed or
drugged people on the pavement.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="griffith-observatory"><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griffith_Observatory">Griffith
Observatory</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>We wanted to visit this fantastic observatory on top of the hills in
Griffith Park, watch a movie in its theater and see the views of LA
downtown from there.</li>
<li>However, there was simply to parking, even on a Tuesday afternoon!
We had to just drive back.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="baps-shri-swaminarayan-mandir"><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAPS_Shri_Swaminarayan_Mandir_Chino_Hills">BAPS
Shri Swaminarayan Mandir</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Instead of Griffith Observatory, we drove to this beautiful temple
out in the city of Chino Hills. The traffic was tedious both ways.</li>
<li>The temple campus and the temple itself looks beautiful from
outside. A great place to take photos and sit outside.</li>
<li>The inside of the temple is shockingly small, has too many pillars
blocking any chance of enjoying the interior and there is simply to no
space for a group of devotees to sit or stand together. Shockingly
different from the temple interior design in South Indian temples.</li>
</ul>
