<p>I wanted to like and love <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ek_Main_Aur_Ekk_Tu"><strong>Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu</strong></a>, but sadly I cannot. <strong>Kareena Kapoor</strong> and <strong>Imran Khan</strong> star in this romantic-comedy from the Karan Johar camp. Imran Khan has led the clean and proper life his parents wanted him to lead for all his life. When he loses his job at Las Vegas during Christmas, he has a wild night out on the town with Kareena Kapoor. They become good friends, she showing him how to break out of his shell and live freely. He finally stands up to his over-bearing parents, but his feelings of love towards Kareena turn out to be misdirected.</p>
<p>EMAET is disappointing. It is created around what seems like a good idea, but the plot is tepid even in its best moments. Imran is flat and uninteresting while Kareena is over-the-top. Other than the title track, none of the music is memorable either. The camerawork is quite beautiful, evoking interest that is rarely satisfied by the characters or their predicament. There are better ways to kill your time than with Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu.</p>
