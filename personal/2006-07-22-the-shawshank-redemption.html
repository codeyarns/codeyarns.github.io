<p>Some people have <a href="http://www.imdb.com/chart/top">called
this</a> the best movie <em>ever</em>. I certainly didn’t feel so, but
this certainly goes into the <em>great</em> movies category. <a
href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111161/">The Shawshank Redemption</a>
is a 1994 movie based on the novella <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rita_Hayworth_and_Shawshank_Redemption">Rita
Hayworth And Shawshank Redemption</a> written by Stephen King. The story
revolves around Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) who has been convicted of
murdering his wife and her lover and who is sentenced to life
imprisonment. At the prison he becomes friends with Red (Morgan Freeman)
who is the narrator of the story in the movie. While everyone in the
prison (most of whom are there for life sentences) are counting their
days (decades is a practical term), Andy never gives up hope. He sticks
to hope doggedly despite the pessimistic atmosphere of the prison, the
felons and the prison guards. In the end, Andy’s hope is answered.</p>
<p>This movie is directed by <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Darabont">Frank Darabont</a>.
Anyone who’s read a Stephen King novel knows the distinct kind of world
he creates in the reader’s mind. Frank seems to have the knack of
bringing that experience to a movie audience. (Little surprise that he
later directed King’s <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120689/">The
Green Mile</a> too, which I liked). Tim Robbins and especially Morgan
Freeman are superlative in their acting here. Full marks on the
cinematography, dialogues and the background score. This movie is
flawless. And when you rewind the story in your head and realize the
analogy in it to life, it goes a notch further. It joins the ranks of
great movies. A very inspirational watch.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 5/5</p>
