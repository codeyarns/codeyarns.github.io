<p>Some people have <a href="http://www.imdb.com/chart/top">called this</a> the best movie <em>ever</em>. I certainly didn't feel so, but this certainly goes into the <em>great</em> movies category. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111161/">The Shawshank Redemption</a> is a 1994 movie based on the novella <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rita_Hayworth_and_Shawshank_Redemption">Rita Hayworth And Shawshank Redemption</a> written by Stephen King. The story revolves around Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) who has been convicted of murdering his wife and her lover and who is sentenced to life imprisonment. At the prison he becomes friends with Red (Morgan Freeman) who is the narrator of the story in the movie. While everyone in the prison (most of whom are there for life sentences) are counting their days (decades is a practical term), Andy never gives up hope. He sticks to hope doggedly despite the pessimistic atmosphere of the prison, the felons and the prison guards. In the end, Andy's hope is answered.</p>
<p>This movie is directed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Darabont">Frank Darabont</a>. Anyone who's read a Stephen King novel knows the distinct kind of world he creates in the reader's mind. Frank seems to have the knack of bringing that experience to a movie audience. (Little surprise that he later directed King's <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120689/">The Green Mile</a> too, which I liked). Tim Robbins and especially Morgan Freeman are superlative in their acting here. Full marks on the cinematography, dialogues and the background score. This movie is flawless. And when you rewind the story in your head and realize the analogy in it to life, it goes a notch further. It joins the ranks of great movies. A very inspirational watch.</p>
