<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 3/4 (Despite a disappointing Season 1, all Dilbert fans will enjoy the philosophy and sarcasm of Season 2.)</p>
<p>While the <strong>Dilbert</strong> cartoon strip is extremely popular, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilbert_%28TV_series%29">TV series</a> that was based on this is not. The animated TV series avatar of the cartoon was conceived by Scott Adams and directed by Larry Charles. It lasted only 2 seasons during 1999-2000.</p>
<p>Having seen and read Dilbert strips for years, it takes a while to adjust to the animated characters and voices in the TV series. The voice casting has been done superbly, their voices closely matched that which I had in my head for them. Season 1 introduces the cast of Dilbert and recreates the office scenarios which one is used to seeing in the strips. Season 2 takes on a completely different track and treats serious philosophical topics with the trademark sarcasm of Dilbert.</p>
<p>Season 1 is boring and was disappointing, especially for this viewer who is a huge fan of Dilbert and Scott Adams. Season 2 seizes the creative reins, breaking completely free of the shackles Dilbert has in his newspaper strips. It turns out to be entirely satisfying, taking on shades of philosophy and nihilism, asking deep existential questions laced with extreme tongue-in-cheek humour. Despite how disppointing S1 is, all Dilbert fans should catch the TV series to see Dogbert, evil Catbert and the Pointy Haired Boss come to life.</p>
