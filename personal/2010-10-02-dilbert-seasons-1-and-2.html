<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 3/4 (Despite a disappointing Season 1, all
Dilbert fans will enjoy the philosophy and sarcasm of Season 2.)</p>
<p>While the <strong>Dilbert</strong> cartoon strip is extremely
popular, the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilbert_%28TV_series%29">TV
series</a> that was based on this is not. The animated TV series avatar
of the cartoon was conceived by Scott Adams and directed by Larry
Charles. It lasted only 2 seasons during 1999-2000.</p>
<p>Having seen and read Dilbert strips for years, it takes a while to
adjust to the animated characters and voices in the TV series. The voice
casting has been done superbly, their voices closely matched that which
I had in my head for them. Season 1 introduces the cast of Dilbert and
recreates the office scenarios which one is used to seeing in the
strips. Season 2 takes on a completely different track and treats
serious philosophical topics with the trademark sarcasm of Dilbert.</p>
<p>Season 1 is boring and was disappointing, especially for this viewer
who is a huge fan of Dilbert and Scott Adams. Season 2 seizes the
creative reins, breaking completely free of the shackles Dilbert has in
his newspaper strips. It turns out to be entirely satisfying, taking on
shades of philosophy and nihilism, asking deep existential questions
laced with extreme tongue-in-cheek humour. Despite how disppointing S1
is, all Dilbert fans should catch the TV series to see Dogbert, evil
Catbert and the Pointy Haired Boss come to life.</p>
