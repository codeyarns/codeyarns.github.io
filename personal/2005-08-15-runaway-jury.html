<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 3/4 (Full of thrills and twists, a good
watch)</p>
<p>Based on a John Grisham novel by the same name, <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runaway_Jury">Runaway Jury</a> is a
movie based on a legal case. A stockbroker has been shot dead by a
disgruntled employee. His widow sues the gun company for selling
firearms. The gun company brings in their expert jury consultant Gene
Hackman. Fighting for the widow is Dustin Hoffman, who not only wants to
win this case, but also use this as a precedent for all gun cases in the
country. The gun companies have never lost a case thanks to the <em><a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution">Second
Amendment</a></em> of the US Constitution. The stage is set for the
trial of the century!</p>
<p>The surprise element is an innocent looking jury member John Cusack.
He is a videogame salesman and turns out to be a trickster. He and his
accomplice blackmail both the sides for several million dollars to swing
the jury to their side. Who pays up? Who wins the case?</p>
<p>I am a sucker for movies in a legal setting and this one was no
exception. Good movie with lots of thrilling moments and the trademark
John Grisham twist-in-the-tale. Well worth watching.</p>
