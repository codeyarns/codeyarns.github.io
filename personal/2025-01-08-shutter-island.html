<p>I had watched the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shutter_Island"><strong>Shutter
Island</strong></a> movie <a href="2010-10-09-shutter-island.html">a
long time ago</a> and remember having loved it, so picking up the novel
by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Lehane"><strong>Dennis
Lehane</strong></a> was easy. Few years after WW2, US Marshals <em>Teddy
Daniels</em> and <em>Chuck Aule</em> arrive on the desolate Shutter
Island to investigate a mysterious disappearance. The island off the
Boston coast houses a securely guarded mental hospital for the
criminally insane. After getting introduced to the deputy warden
McPherson and the head Dr. Crawley, the Marshals examine the room of the
missing patient Rachel Solando. She seems to have disappeared overnight
from her locked room with no trace, only leaving behind a code. The
Marshals start to explore the hospital facilities and the island and
discover a highly secure ward where secret experiments are performed on
patients. A tremendous hurricane hits the island, disabling ferry access
and radio communication, killing power to the facilities and unleashing
the dangerous patients. By the time the dangerous inmates are all locked
back up, Teddy seems to have uncovered the dark secret of the hospital
and his wife’s killer Andrew Laeddis.</p>
<p>The slow build of intrigue and darkness in this book is relentless
and exciting. As we learn every new detail of the island, hospital,
staff or patients, our mystery only deepens on how Rachel disappeared
(and later reappeared) and the nature of the experiments at the
hospital. Teddy is a WW2 veteran and his PTSD of witnessing the Nazi
concentration camps, migraine attacks and flashbacks of his loving wife
Dolores, who was killed in a fire, highly clouds his judgement in this
case. The 3 acts in the book are perfect, with a satisfyingly
firecracking twist at the end. This was a deliciously scary and
mysterious read!</p>
<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 4/5</p>
