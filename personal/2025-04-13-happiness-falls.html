<p>How a family of a special needs child deals with the disappearance of
their father is at the center of <strong>Happiness Falls</strong>. We
learn about the disappearance through the voice of <em>Mia</em>, the
daughter of a Korean mother (<em>Hannah Park</em>) and a white father
(<em>Adam Parson</em>). Her younger brother <em>Eugene</em>, who has
speech and movement impairments (Angelman Syndrome) had accompanied Adam
to a nearby state park and returned home alone. Mia mistakenly assumes
her dad is at home and several precious hours are lost before the police
are called and a missing person search is started. As detective
<em>Janus</em> probes into the hours before the disappearance she
discovers that Eugene might have attacked his father in a burst of anger
that morning. At the same time, Mia digs into her dad’s life and
discovers that he and Eugene had been seeing a therapist <em>Anjeli
Rapari</em> in secret. As the hours turn into days, the family is drawn
into a legal custody battle while also discovering uncomfortable and
surprising things about themselves.</p>
<p>The author <em>Angie Kim</em> deftly keeps many balls in the air at
the same time - a super intriguing mystery, Asian family drama, and
special needs children and their impact on a relationship and family.
The book is extremely detailed about the caring, terminology, treatments
and upbringing of special needs children. Some great analogies are
provided in the book about how society fails to appreciate Eugene’s
intelligence since it is hidden behind his motor and speech impediments.
The author easily takes the reader on a ride, making me believe that
Adam was having an affair with Anjeli. The weakest part of the book is
probably the over-emphasis on Adam’s notes on <em>Happiness Quotient
(HQ)</em>. Nevertheless, Angie is a tour de force here, crafting a
meticulous, intriguing and sensitive tale.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/5</p>
<h2 id="excerpts">Excerpts</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>I don’t understand people who pop out of sleep at the first alarm. I
love snoozing. A push of a button, elongating the surreal haze of that
liminal phase, letting me linger in the delicious afterglow of the dream
world where anything is possible, where I can think something and it’s
suddenly there the next moment, no transition, no explanation, no logic.
It’s like sitting in the theater after a great movie has ended,
listening to the score as the credits scroll, giving you time to reflect
before you head back to the real world.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As Mom likes to point out, it’s fascinating how it’s called
“retirement” when fathers quit their jobs, but “becoming a stay-at-home
mom” when mothers do.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>She stopped doing therapy homework with Eugene, said she wanted to
accept Eugene—“as he is, with no expectations.” (But, as Dad always
pointed out, how can you not have expectations of a child? What is a
child if not as-yet-unrealized potential personified?)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There are moments when something we’ve idealized all our lives
changes and becomes something less. Not by a noticeable amount, just an
infinitesimal disappointment. But it’s like going from 100 percent to
99.9 percent—imperceptible quantitatively, but dramatically different
qualitatively, from flawless to flawed. After this point, I found myself
questioning Dad’s motives, doubting his perspectives, in a way I hadn’t
before.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Have you ever had your parents teach/tutor you (or, if you’re a
parent, tried to teach/tutor your own child)? In my family’s experience,
it’s torture, ending in raised voices and tears for everyone involved. I
don’t know what it is, but everything my parents said, even (maybe
especially) if delivered gently and lovingly, I couldn’t help but take
personally—as an expression of disappointment, a buried wish they had a
different child. It made me vacillate between trying too hard, desperate
to impress, and refusing to cooperate and giving up, both to cope with
the anxiety overload and to punish them for putting me into that state
to begin with. If getting better at math or baseball was this fraught, I
couldn’t imagine practicing communication with a nonspeaking child—the
expectations, the fears, the anxiety magnified ten thousandfold.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Of course you will and can want more. You should want more. But you
should also spend time trying to want what you already have. It’s
slightly different from “practicing gratitude” or appreciating or
thanking a higher force or God for what you have. It means: Don’t let
what you already have be the baseline. Think of yourself before you
gained what you have, and remind yourself how much you want that, what
you already have—your spouse/partner, your family, your house, your job.
Imagine you in an alternate universe where you don’t have your family,
can’t have your kids or your partner, how desperate that alternate-you
would be to get what you have.</p>
