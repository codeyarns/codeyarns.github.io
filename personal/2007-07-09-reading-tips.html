<p>Here are some reading tips that work for me. I had jotted these down a long time ago and came across the document today. Do comment or share on what works for you.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: Reading does not have to be your hobby. There is no need to force yourself to do it when you know you do not like it. But, if you like reading, but for some reason feel you are not doing enough, then read on.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The hardest part is starting. Just like getting into cold water, this is something that might not be pleasant, but has to be done. The only way to do it is to dig in and stay committed for at least a few pages. If it still does not interest you, keep it aside and try again sometime later. If you still cannot do it after a few times, the book is probably not for you. Pick up something else. On an average I abandon half the books which I start on.</p></li>
<li><p>Maintain a list of books you wish to read. Update it regularly with new books that interest you from your friends’ blogs, online reviews and tweets. Even more important is to weed out books which you think you have lost interest in. The Amazon wish-list or dedicated sites like GoodReads are great for keeping lists like this.</p></li>
<li><p>Borrow the book from a library or a friend rather than buy it. (This definitely works for me!) While the few books I own still lie unread, the compulsion of a return due date or impending fine is enough push for me to complete or abandon my library book.</p></li>
<li><p>Read your friends’ book reviews. Write your own when you finish a book. Active participation and getting comments from others stokes your interest and keeps it going all year.</p></li>
<li><p>Make some time in your daily or weekly schedule for reading. If you can read in increments every day or night, do that. (This typically does not work for me.) Or keep aside some time during your weekend. (This is how I read.)</p></li>
<li><p>Read one book at a time. If you really want to read more, not more than three at a time. This forces you to either complete or abandon a book instead of clinging onto it and several more for eternity.</p></li>
<li><p>When picking the next book try choosing something different than last time. (This is where your list comes in handy.) This removes the boredom of reading the same genre every time.</p></li>
<li><p>Carry the books you are reading wherever you go. You never know when you will get a few minutes to whip it out. You can gets loads of regular reading done if you commute to work.</p></li>
<li><p>If you cannot find a book in the library, request them to get it. You will be surprised how happy library folks are to have members who actually want them to get some books. In my opinion, this is also a great (and free) way of helping everyone else.</p></li>
<li><p>And most importantly, enjoy reading. It is not a chore, but it is not something that you can do in a few minutes too. No matter what your taste (fiction/non-fiction/drama/romance/comics) there is something out there for you. Hop in and start reading. If you find that books are crap, then maybe writing is your calling. 😉</p></li>
</ul>
