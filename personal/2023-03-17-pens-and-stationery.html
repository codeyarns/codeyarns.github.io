<p>Most of my day is spent in front of digital screens. However, I have increasingly found that writing on paper feels different and I like jotting and annotating on paper. Plus my son uses a lot of stationery for his school and writing. All of this puts me in touch with a lot of stationery and frankly there is a lot of terrible stuff out there. These ratings are a reference for me to not buy the terrible stuff and get the good stuff.</p>
<h2 id="fountain-pens">Fountain pens</h2>
<h3 id="twsbi-eco-t"><a href="https://www.twsbi.com/products/twsbi-eco-t-clear-fountain-pen">TWSBI Eco-T</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>This is a large pen that is fully transparent. So, it is nice to look at the inner workings above the nib and the entire ink in the holder sloshing around.</li>
<li>It is available in all nib sizes. But I got the <em>medium</em> and it seems to be perfect for my writing.</li>
<li>The pen is slightly on the heavier side, but that weight is spread around its thicker and taller body. So overall, I do not feel that it is heavy, but it feels right.</li>
<li>The primary reason I got this pen is for its ink capacity of <strong>1.8 ml</strong> which is probably the largest among common pens.</li>
<li>An added bonus is that the piston filling mechanism is built right into the main body of the pen. I do not need to open the bottom to get inside to fill or need any other extra equipment needed to fill the pen.</li>
<li>The cap has a perfect seal. I have picked up this pen even after months of not using and it just started writing like normal.</li>
<li>The Eco-T differs from the Eco with its triangular grip. I prefer this to the round grip of traditional pens since it helps position my fingers correctly so that the nib is pointed correctly for the right writing.</li>
<li>This has become my primary driver pen at home. It is a tad large and heavy to carry outside though.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/4</p>
<h3 id="majohn-a1">Majohn A1</h3>
<ul>
<li>I started looking for retractable fountain pens and discovered this economical pen. A couple of other popular retractable pens like Lamy and Pilot Vanishing Point are quite expensive.</li>
<li>This pen can be ordered on AliExpress.</li>
<li>The pen is actually built of metal and feels heavy and substantial.</li>
<li>It has both clipped and clipless versions. I bought the clipless version since having a clip near the finger grip feels terribly awkward to me.</li>
<li>An initial problem I had with this pen was that it dried out quickly within a couple of days. Also, its writing was too fine for my taste. Trying to widen the nib with a blade, I ruined it. Since the nib cannot be changed easily, I ordered the whole internal body of the pen from AliExpress. This replacement worked beautifully after I did some vertical pressing exercises to increase the thickness of the stroke.</li>
<li>I found the ink volume in the squeeze converter that came with the pen to be less. Switching to an eyedropper converter increased the ink volume sufficient enough to be usable.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 3/4</p>
<h3 id="majohn-a2">Majohn A2</h3>
<ul>
<li>This is the 2nd version of the A1 retractable pen. The inner body, nib and mechanism are the same as A1. The difference is the outer body, which is plastic. So, this pen is far lighter than the A1.</li>
<li>There is no clipless pen available in this series. So, I was forced to order a clipped pen and I have grown to like it. The clip actually helps align my fingers, so that the nib is pointing forward in the right direction.</li>
<li>The nib seemed to be scratchy and thin at the beginning. But once I pressed hard on it and drew a few vertical lines, it became super smooth like butter. Right now, this is one of the smoothest pens I have used and it is turning out to be pure delight.</li>
<li>The pen is super light. It truly feels like a ball pen instead of a fountain pen.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 4/4</p>
<h3 id="retractables">Retractables</h3>
<p>The other retractable fountain pens that people seem to be using are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Majohn A2</li>
<li>Pilot Capless</li>
<li>Pilot Decimo</li>
<li>Pilot Vanishing Point</li>
<li>Platinum Curidas</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="gel-pens">Gel pens</h2>
<h3 id="bic-gel-ocity">BIC Gel-Ocity</h3>
<ul>
<li>Writes as smooth as a great fountain pen. It is unbelievable, like a dream!</li>
<li>I have tried the 0.7 mm in light blue. This thickness is right for me.</li>
<li>One of the quickest drying gel pens.</li>
<li>The clicker is not smooth, but I can live with that.</li>
<li>The rest of the pen exterior is decent, not as many features as the Japanese pens.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/4</p>
<h3 id="uni-ball-signo-207">Uni-ball Signo 207</h3>
<ul>
<li>Writes as smoothly as you expect from a gel pen.</li>
<li>I have tried the click pen version in 0.7 mm in black. Line is thicker, almost like a 1.0 mm.</li>
<li>Takes forever to dry, almost as long as a fountain pen.</li>
<li>Ink is supposed to be fraud resistant, so a good choice for signing and for checks.</li>
<li>Great exterior, has the most comfortable feel in hand.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 3/4</p>
<h3 id="pilot-frixion-synergy-clicker">PILOT FriXion Synergy Clicker</h3>
<ul>
<li>The killer feature of this pen is that its writing can be erased by using the eraser on top.</li>
<li>Writing feel is at the level of a good ball pen, not a gel pen. This was surprising to me, since I expected it would feel like a gel pen.</li>
<li>Erasing works, but needs quite some force and it does leave faint residue and paper will be slightly depressed from that force.</li>
<li>The retracting is on the side since the top is occupied by the eraser. Sliding action is decent, not great.</li>
<li>I have tried the XFine 0.5 mm in black, red and blue. It turned out to be too fine, the line is too thin for my taste. The nib is too thin too, feels like it would break with pressure.</li>
<li>The whole pen is too thin and light and feels a bit cheap in the hand.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 2/4</p>
<h2 id="ballpoint-pens">Ballpoint pens</h2>
<h3 id="pilot-acroball"><a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Acroball-Ballpoint-Pen-1.0-mm-Red/pd/34402">Pilot Acroball</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Writes better than any other ballpoint pen. Very smooth, just a tad worse than a good gel pen.</li>
<li>I have tried the M (medium) size in red. Line is thick like a 1.0 mm.</li>
<li>Great clicker and great feel in hand.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 3/4</p>
<h3 id="bic-cristal-original"><a href="https://www.penaddict.com/blog/2016/1/17/bic-cristal-ballpoint-pen-review">BIC Cristal Original</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>This is a version of the classic BIC pen. Writing action is OK, there is some force needed, so not ideal for personal use.</li>
<li>I have tried black in 1.0 mm.</li>
<li>Sells in large packs for a few dollars. So very low price.</li>
<li>Maybe good for travel or handing out to others for quick use or as backup. I would not use this as my primary pen.</li>
</ul>
