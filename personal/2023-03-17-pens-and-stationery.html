<p>Most of my day is spent in front of digital screens. However, I have
increasingly found that writing on paper feels different and I like
jotting and annotating on paper. Plus my son uses a lot of stationery
for his school and writing. All of this puts me in touch with a lot of
stationery and frankly there is a lot of terrible stuff out there. These
ratings are a reference for me to not buy the terrible stuff and get the
good stuff.</p>
<h2 id="fountain-pens">Fountain pens</h2>
<h3 id="twsbi-eco-t"><a
href="https://www.twsbi.com/products/twsbi-eco-t-clear-fountain-pen">TWSBI
Eco-T</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>This is a large pen that is fully transparent. So, it is nice to
look at the inner workings above the nib and the entire ink in the
holder sloshing around.</li>
<li>It is available in all nib sizes. But I got the <em>medium</em> and
it seems to be perfect for my writing.</li>
<li>The pen is slightly on the heavier side, but that weight is spread
around its thicker and taller body. So overall, I do not feel that it is
heavy, but it feels right.</li>
<li>The primary reason I got this pen is for its ink capacity of
<strong>1.8 ml</strong> which is probably the largest among common
pens.</li>
<li>An added bonus is that the piston filling mechanism is built right
into the main body of the pen. I do not need to open the bottom to get
inside to fill or need any other extra equipment needed to fill the
pen.</li>
<li>The cap has a perfect seal. I have picked up this pen even after
months of not using and it just started writing like normal.</li>
<li>The Eco-T differs from the Eco with its triangular grip. I prefer
this to the round grip of traditional pens since it helps position my
fingers correctly so that the nib is pointed correctly for the right
writing.</li>
<li>This has become my primary driver pen at home. It is a tad large and
heavy to carry outside though.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 5/5</p>
<h3 id="majohn-a1">Majohn A1</h3>
<ul>
<li>I started looking for retractable fountain pens and discovered this
economical pen. A couple of other popular retractable pens like Lamy and
Pilot Vanishing Point are quite expensive.</li>
<li>This pen has clipped and clipless versions and comes in various
colors. Initially, it was offered only in EF, and the F arrived
later.</li>
<li>This pen can be ordered on AliExpress. I got the clipless black one
in EF (since F was not available back then).</li>
<li>The black clipless version is actually built of metal and feels
heavy and substantial.</li>
<li>I bought the clipless version since I assumed that having a clip
near the finger grip might feel awkward.</li>
<li>When I got the pen, it would dry out quickly within a couple of
days. Also, its writing was too EF for my taste. I ruined it trying to
widen the nib with a blade.</li>
<li>Since the nib cannot be changed easily, I ordered the whole internal
body of the pen from AliExpress. This replacement worked beautifully
after I did some vertical pressing exercises to increase the thickness
of the stroke.</li>
<li>I found the ink volume in the squeeze converter that came with the
pen to be less. Switching to an eyedropper converter increased the ink
volume sufficient enough to last for a long time.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 3/5</p>
<h3 id="majohn-a2">Majohn A2</h3>
<ul>
<li>This is the 2nd version of the A1 retractable pen. The inner body,
nib and mechanism are the same as A1. The difference is the outer body,
which is plastic. So, this pen is far lighter than the A1.</li>
<li>There is no clipless pen available in this series. So, I was forced
to order a clipped pen and I went with muted yellow.</li>
<li>The clip actually helps align my fingers, so that the nib is
pointing forward in the right direction.</li>
<li>The nib seemed to be scratchy and thin at the beginning. But once I
pressed hard on it and drew a few vertical lines, it became super smooth
like butter. Right now, this is one of the smoothest pens I have used
and it is turning out to be pure delight.</li>
<li>The pen is super light. It truly feels like a ball pen instead of a
fountain pen.</li>
<li>I ordered EF nibs, but pulling out the original nib ruined it. The
EF nib was OK, not as great as the original nib.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 4/5</p>
<h3 id="jinhao-10">Jinhao 10</h3>
<ul>
<li>Jinhao entered the retractable game with this pen series. The
internal body and nib are exactly same as Majohn A1/A2.</li>
<li>I got the brass metal pen and it feels heavy and damn nice in
hand.</li>
<li>I went with F and it has been a butter smooth delight to write.</li>
<li>Just like the Majohn pens, the twist converter it came with has
little volume, so I swapped in an eyedropper converter.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 4/5</p>
<h3 id="retractables">Retractables</h3>
<p>The other retractable fountain pens that people seem to be using
are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pilot Capless</li>
<li>Pilot Decimo</li>
<li>Pilot Vanishing Point</li>
<li>Platinum Curidas</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="gel-pens">Gel pens</h2>
<h3 id="bic-gel-ocity">BIC Gel-Ocity</h3>
<ul>
<li>Writes as smooth as a great fountain pen. It is unbelievable, like a
dream!</li>
<li>I have tried the 0.7 mm in light blue. This thickness is right for
me.</li>
<li>One of the quickest drying gel pens.</li>
<li>The clicker is not smooth, but I can live with that.</li>
<li>The rest of the pen exterior is decent, not as many features as the
Japanese pens.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/5</p>
<h3 id="uni-ball-signo-207">Uni-ball Signo 207</h3>
<ul>
<li>Writes as smoothly as you expect from a gel pen.</li>
<li>I have tried the click pen version in 0.7 mm in black. Line is
thicker, almost like a 1.0 mm.</li>
<li>Takes forever to dry, almost as long as a fountain pen.</li>
<li>Ink is supposed to be fraud resistant, so a good choice for signing
and for checks.</li>
<li>Great exterior, has the most comfortable feel in hand.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 3/5</p>
<h3 id="pilot-frixion-synergy-clicker">PILOT FriXion Synergy
Clicker</h3>
<ul>
<li>The killer feature of this pen is that its writing can be erased by
using the eraser on top.</li>
<li>Writing feel is at the level of a good ball pen, not a gel pen. This
was surprising to me, since I expected it would feel like a gel
pen.</li>
<li>Erasing works, but needs quite some force and it does leave faint
residue and paper will be slightly depressed from that force.</li>
<li>The retracting is on the side since the top is occupied by the
eraser. Sliding action is decent, not great.</li>
<li>I have tried the XFine 0.5 mm in black, red and blue. It turned out
to be too fine, the line is too thin for my taste. The nib is too thin
too, feels like it would break with pressure.</li>
<li>The whole pen is too thin and light and feels a bit cheap in the
hand.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 2/5</p>
<h2 id="ballpoint-pens">Ballpoint pens</h2>
<h3 id="pilot-acroball"><a
href="https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Acroball-Ballpoint-Pen-1.0-mm-Red/pd/34402">Pilot
Acroball</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Writes better than any other ballpoint pen. Very smooth, just a tad
worse than a good gel pen.</li>
<li>I have tried the M (medium) size in red. Line is thick like a 1.0
mm.</li>
<li>Great clicker and great feel in hand.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 3/5</p>
<h3 id="bic-cristal-original"><a
href="https://www.penaddict.com/blog/2016/1/17/bic-cristal-ballpoint-pen-review">BIC
Cristal Original</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>This is a version of the classic BIC pen. Writing action is OK,
there is some force needed, so not ideal for personal use.</li>
<li>I have tried black in 1.0 mm.</li>
<li>Sells in large packs for a few dollars. So very low price.</li>
<li>Maybe good for travel or handing out to others for quick use or as
backup. I would not use this as my primary pen.</li>
</ul>
