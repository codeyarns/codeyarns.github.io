<h1 class="title">Craving for some pho</h1>

<p>A few days ago, I started to crave badly for <strong>Vietnamese
food</strong>. What sparked it off was my reminiscing about a
backpacking trip in Vietnam I did a few years ago. And the highlight of
that trip for me had been Vietnamese food.</p>
<p>Deciding to satiate this craving, this Saturday we searched for
Vietnamese restaurants in Singapore. The number is surprisingly few,
considering how many Vietnamese are here. A small joint named
<strong>Long Phung</strong> came highly recommended and we headed off
there.</p>
<p>It is located in <strong>Joo Chiat Road</strong>, an area off Bugis
which I had never explored. The region is full of old two-storey Chinese
longhouses which have been converted into small restaurants, bars and
hostels. We arrived at Long Phung at 6PM, but the place was already
packed. The customers were mostly Vietnamese, which I noted as a good
sign that the food would be close to authentic.</p>

<p>The menu is in Vietnamese, but thankfully it has photos, so I knew
what to order. We started off with <strong>Gỏi cuốn</strong> and
<strong>Chả giò</strong>. Gỏi cuốn is rice, prawn, pork and herbs rolled
in rice paper. With the accompanying peanut sauce, it was delicious and
quite heavy. Chả giò is a fried spring roll of minced pork. This was
just right, crispy and not-so-oily.</p>

<p>Gỏi cuốn was quite filling, but I had to have my pho. We ordered
<strong>Phở Gà</strong>, the chicken version of the Vietnamese noodle
soup. It is a bowl of chicken, rice noodles, various herbs, onion and
broth. The taste was quite similar to what I had eaten in South Vietnam.
The flavor of the herbs was a bit muted though.</p>

<p>We ended the journey with the closest cousin of South Indian filter
coffee: <strong>Cà phê sữa nóng</strong>. You choose whether you want it
hot or color and with or without milk. Every cup of Vietnamese coffee
comes with its own filter. The cup is filled with cold milk, you place
the filter on top with coffee powder inside it. Pour hot water into the
filter and it drips down and you have your coffee. The coffee was rich
and a pleasing end to the meal.</p>
<p>When we left, the joint was full with a crowd waiting outside for a
table. The weather was cool and windy and we took a walk along the road.
Though there were a few other Vietnamese joints nearby, this was the
only one which was full. Waiting for our bus, I realized how you could
relish so many old memories with just some food.</p>
