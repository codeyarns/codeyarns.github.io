<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 3/4 (Confusing plot, but splendid
acting)</p>
<p>Usually Julia Roberts hogs the screen in any movie she appears in.
Not so in <em><a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closer_%28film%29">Closer</a></em>, a
romantic drama based on a play of the same name. In <em>Closer</em>, the
principal characters (2 males and 2 females) prevaricate on their love
and switch many times. Dan (Jude Law) runs into Alice (Natalie Portman)
in London and falls in love at first sight. Just when their relationship
is maturing, Dan meets Cameron (Julia Roberts) and starts to secretly
love her. A gimmick by Dan brings Cameron together with Larry (Clive
Owen) and they too fall in love, after Cameron decides to forget Dan.
Things do not go according to plan and Cameron breaks up with Larry, Dan
breaks up with Alice and the heartbroken Larry tries to woo Alice. In
this game of musical chairs, one couple finds longlasting love and the
other do not.</p>
<p>Jude Law and Natalie Portman easily overshadow Julia Roberts and
bring a magnetic appeal to every scene they appear in. Jude Law is
especially notable in the opening act when he falls in love with
Portman. Clive Owen has actually acted in the <em>Closer</em> play, but
I found his delivery quite heavy handed. The viewer is also left
confused if Larry (Clive Owen) is genuinely in search of love, or he is
just playing the maniac villain wrecking the lives of those around him.
The plot is a bit confusing, I could not really see why people would
play around like in the movie. Still, <em>Closer</em> is intriguing and
packs great acting prowess.</p>
