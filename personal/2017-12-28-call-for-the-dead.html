<p>I quite liked the first <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_le_Carr%C3%A9"><strong>John le
Carre</strong></a> book I read recently (<a
href="2017-01-22-the-spy-who-came-in-from-the-cold.html"><strong>The spy
who came in from the cold</strong></a>), so I have decided to read a few
more of his spy thrillers. <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_for_the_Dead"><strong>Call for
the Dead</strong></a> is his first book, where the eponymous
<strong>George Smiley</strong> is introduced. The edition I read had a
beautiful introduction, written for this later edition by the author,
detailing his actual spy work and how he got into writing. This alone is
worthy enough to pick up this slim novella. The book begins with a new
publicity-seeking boss at Britain’s spy machinery, who upsets folks like
Smiley who are at the end of their career. At this moment, a series of
mysterious events takes place. Smiley interviews an old Communist
working in the Foreign Office cause someone complained about him. That
man turns up dead in his house the next day, a case of suicide with a
note left behind. Everything is accounted for and the case is almost
being tied up when Smiley receives a pre-scheduled call at the man’s
house from the telephone exchange that cannot be explained. Following
that thread leads him to unraveling a spy web run by the East German
intelligence in London.</p>
<p>As always, le Carre is just a great writer. The stodgy slow-moving
bureaucracy of the British intelligence and the very-real depictions of
how actual spy networks are embedded are delicious to consume. This is
the sort of novel I prefer, just a handful of characters and lots of
intrigue. Though this is a very short novel, it still slows down and
lags a bit in the middle. Minor quibbles about what is a great
nail-biting read that nicely ties up all your suspicions by the end.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 3/4</p>
<p><strong>ISBN:</strong> 9780143122579</p>
