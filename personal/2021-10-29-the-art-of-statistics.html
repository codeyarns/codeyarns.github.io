<p>I regularly look for book recommendations from folks I admire. When
both Terence and Deepak talked about <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Art-Statistics-How-Learn-Data/dp/1541618513/"><strong>The
Art of Statistics</strong></a> I decided to read it straightaway. The
author <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Spiegelhalter"><strong>David
Spiegelhalter</strong></a> has spent his entire life at the Royal
Statistical Society in UK, aiding government, courts, hospitals and
corporations with his weapons of statistics. And classic British humor
is everywhere in this book that reads like a whodunit or problem solver,
motivating all fields of statistics with real and famous examples from
history or the author’s past.</p>
<p>The early chapters (1 and 2) introduce summary statistics like mean,
median and standard deviation. Graphs are also introduced and all manner
of graphs remain a constant feature throughout the book. Chapter 3
features random sampling and normal distribution, which is used in
Gallup polls. The following chapter gets into the complexities of how
randomized controlled trials are conducted for new drugs. How do we
distinguish between corelation and causation - that is discussed a lot
with real examples. In chapter 5, we see regression models and how
everything regresses to the mean.</p>
<p>We get to the current hotness of machine learning in chapter 6 with a
cursory look at classification trees, ROC curves and such. The author
stresses on the challenges of using algorithms due to problems like bias
and hard to interpret. We are far from summary statistics and in the
land of probability theory in chapter 8. And in the following chapter,
statistics and probability are used together for statistical inference.
The latter chapters get into statistical significance and P-values and
Bayesian probability. The book ends with a broad look at statistics are
misused and guidelines for how to do better.</p>
<p>I felt the author made the book a lot of fun to read with his humor,
showing the history behind every statistical innovation and famous
statistician and most importantly the great real-world examples used to
motivate every concept. The biggest takeaway from the book for me were
those examples, witnessing the messiness and complexity of applying
stats in the real world in medicine, criminal cases, courts and
government policies. The book also has a good glossary with formal
definitions of all the statistical terms and a detailed bibliography
from which I added several more books. The book achieves the breadth,
helps you learn about all the different fields which come under the wide
umbrella of statistics. This is not a book that can be used to study and
learn them, though the author tries to make it easy - you’d need a real
statistics textbook to do that. This was a thoroughly entertaining and
enlightening read and has motivated me to read more math-flavored books
in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/4</p>
