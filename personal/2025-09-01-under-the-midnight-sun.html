<p>I am always up for a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keigo_Higashino"><strong>Keigo
Higashino</strong></a> mystery. <a href="9781250105790"><strong>Under
the Midnight Sun</strong></a> seems to be an older work by him, which
also appears under another name <strong>Journey Under the Midnight
Sun</strong>. I read the English translation by <strong>Alexander O
Smith</strong>.</p>
<p>In typical Higashino style, we start off with a homicide. The victim
<em>Yosuke</em> is a pawnshop owner who has been stabbed to death and is
survived by his wife and son <strong>Ryo</strong>. Detective
<strong>Sasagaki</strong>, along with an early appearance of our famous
<strong>Kagi</strong>, is able to unravel the victim’s affair with a
borrower <strong>Fumiyo</strong>. But she is soon discovered dead due to
a gas leak and survived by her daughter <strong>Yukiho</strong>.
Sasagaki cannot make any further headway into the motive or the
culprit.</p>
<p>From here now, we get to experience a different kind of Higashino
novel. We follow the lives of Yukiho and Ryo for the next 20 years as
they go through high school, careers and relationships. Ryo dabbles in
shady businesses involving women for pleasure, video games and computer
hacking. Yukiho grows up with her rich aunt and develops herself into an
elegant woman who is able to seduce any man and grows her own fashion
store chain. A whole host of characters walk through these two parallel
lives, but we discover how they both manipulate, sexually harass and
even kill people off who intrude on them.</p>
<p>Sasagaki returns to the case 20 years later, retired, but still not
being able to forget it. He finally makes headway discovering the secret
that binds all these primary characters together, what led to the murder
and who did it. In the final chase, Ryo kills himself and Yukiho walks
away, unemotional to his loss.</p>
<p>Unlike the typical Higashino, this novel is much longer at 550 pages
and is a slow burn. This structure was not surprising once I discovered
that this book was originally a serialized magazine story. The changes
in Japanese society and economy are a side character that the author
purposefully mentions during the plot. The characters Ryo and Yukiho are
cold, calculating sociopaths in their own unique way and truly
unforgettable from this story. Sasagaki is not particularly smart here
and there is not much of the usual Higashino cat-and-mouse chase. There
are a few murders which look clever, but we do not get the satisfaction
of learning how they pulled it off. Except for such minor issues, pace
yourself and this is a long, enjoyable and gruesome murder mystery.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/5</p>
<p><strong>ISBN:</strong> 9781250105790</p>
