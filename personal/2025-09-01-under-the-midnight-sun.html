<p>I am always up for a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keigo_Higashino"><strong>Keigo
Higashino</strong></a> mystery. <a href="9781250105790"><strong>Under
the Midnight Sun</strong></a> seems to be an older work by him, which
also appears under another name <strong>Journey Under the Midnight
Sun</strong>. I read the English translation by <strong>Alexander O
Smith</strong>.</p>
<p>In typical Higashino style, we start off with a homicide. The victim
<em>Yosuke</em> is a pawnshop owner who has been stabbed to death and is
survived by his wife and son <strong>Ryo</strong>. Detective
<strong>Sasagaki</strong>, along with an early appearance of our famous
<strong>Kaga</strong>, is able to unravel the victim’s affair with a
borrower <em>Fumiyo</em>. But she is soon discovered dead due to a gas
leak and survived by her daughter <strong>Yukiho</strong>. Sasagaki
cannot make any further headway into the motive or the culprit.</p>
<p>From here on, we get to experience a different kind of Higashino
novel. We follow the lives of Yukiho and Ryo for the next 20 years as
they go through high school, careers and relationships. Ryo dabbles in
shady businesses involving women for pleasure, video games and computer
hacking. Yukiho grows up with her rich aunt and develops herself into an
elegant woman who is able to seduce any man and grows her own fashion
store chain. A whole host of characters walk through their two parallel
lives, but we discover how they both manipulate, sexually harass and
even kill people off who intrude on them.</p>
<p>Sasagaki returns to the case 20 years later, retired, but still not
being able to forget it. He finally makes headway discovering the secret
that binds all these primary characters together, what led to the murder
and who did it. In the final chase, Ryo kills himself and Yukiho walks
away, unemotional to his loss.</p>
<p>Unlike the typical Higashino, this novel is much longer at 550 pages
and is a slow burn. This structure was not surprising once I discovered
that this book was originally a serialized magazine story. The changes
in Japanese society and economy during these 2 decades are a side
character that the author purposefully weaves into the telling. The
characters Ryo and Yukiho are cold, calculating sociopaths in their own
unique way and truly unforgettable from this story. Sasagaki is not
particularly smart here and there is not much of the usual Higashino
cat-and-mouse chase. While there are several clever tricks, there are a
couple of intriguing murders where the author does not fully reveal how
they were pulled off and I found that unsatisfying. Except for such
minor issues, pace yourself and this is a long, enjoyable and gruesome
murder mystery.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/5</p>
<p><strong>ISBN:</strong> 9781250105790</p>
