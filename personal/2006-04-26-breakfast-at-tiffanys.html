<p>Saw the Audrey Hepburn starrer Breakfast At Tiffany's last weekend. Paul, a failed writer moves into a NYC apartment and discovers his cheerful downstairs neighbour Holly. Holly is a drifter from Texas. She has no real work and spends her days throwing parties, drinking and searching for a rich guy to marry. A friendship develops between Holly and Paul which blossoms into love. Inspired, Paul also restarts his writing. But, Holly really isn't sure what she wants to do with her life. Is Holly really in love with him or is she still in love with riches?</p>
<p>This movie is based on a novella by Truman Capote and is quite famous and successful. The novella might have been good, but I found the movie to be quite disappointing. For the most part, it was boring and pointless. George Peppard (playing Paul) is good, but Audrey isn't. If you can survive until the end (which I did since I didn't have anything better to do), the climax is nice-n-romantic. The saving grace of the movie is its dreamy theme song <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_River">Moon River</a></em>. The song got an Oscar.</p>
<p>In case you're wondering about the catchy movie title, Tiffany's is a jewellery store in NYC, Holly loves this store and in the opening scene of the movie she eats her breakfast looking into the store's windows.</p>
