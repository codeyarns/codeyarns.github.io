<p><strong>Ashutosh Gowariker</strong> seems to take his work seriously.
That can be either a boon or a curse for the viewer. While
<strong>Lagaan</strong> generated maniacal fervour, I was far more
impressed by <a
href="2005-02-07-swades.html"><strong>Swades</strong></a>. In <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What%27s_Your_Raashee%3F"><strong>What’s
Your Raashee?</strong></a> he tries his hand at romantic comedy.
<strong>Harman Baweja</strong> is given a task by his family that none
can envy: he has to pick a girl and marry by the end of the month. Given
the limited time he decides to meet one girl from each of the 12
Zodiacal signs. This leads to an interesting journey of meeting females
of different backgrounds, aspirations and mannerisms. He is impressed by
many of them, but who is the one for him?</p>
<p>This movie completely revolves around <strong>Priyanka
Chopra</strong>. Given the impossible task of depicting 12 different
characters, she pulls it off with aplomb and looks ravishing in many of
those roles. I came away totally impressed with PC! While some of the 12
prospects are forgettable, some are quite funny. I am pretty sure PC had
a blast playing the role of the first candidate (the Aries girl). Much
like Gowariker’s earlier movies, the cinematography work here is lovely.
The soundtrack is saddled with the weight of 12+ songs, one for each
sign, but there are some lovely gems amongst them. My favorites include
the jazzy title song, Jao Na, the sad Bikhri Bikhri, the cheesy Sau
Janam, Pyaari Pyaari and Salone Kya. The biggest mistake Gowariker
continues to make is in believing that his audience has the patience to
sit through his creations. Raashee is 3+ hours long and I really pity
the folks who had to endure it at the theatres. With a finger firmly
held on the fast-forward button What’s Your Raashee? is a colorful movie
to catch at home.</p>
