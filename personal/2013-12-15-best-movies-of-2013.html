<h1 class="title">Best movies of 2013</h1>

<p>This has been an excellent year with the movies. I made one of the
best decisions this year: to stop watching commercial movies that were
quite obviously crap. One of the consequences of growing older is that
it finally becomes clear to you what you like and you can start to
really savor that fine stuff. There is simply no reason to be compelled,
at some level, to watch what everyone seems to be talking about.</p>
<p>The bazillion-dollar graphics-laden sequel-bound
lowest-common-denominator crap is what hogs all the attention. But if
you skip past that, the rest of the field is actually getting better.
With a growing TV and multiplex audience, lots of fresh stories with
good implementation are coming from India. With the availability of
subtitles and internet based distribution, there is a virtual
smorgasbord of movies from different countries available for your
tasting.</p>
<p>The following, in no particular order, are what I believe to be the
best amongst the movies I saw this year. I found these movies to be
brilliant in every way: entertaining, engrossing and stimulating. I hope
you will see a few of these movies sometime.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Simple_Life">A Simple
Life</a> (桃姐)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCD00LLZmys"
class="uri">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCD00LLZmys</a></p>
<p>The last act of a relationship between an old maid and the guy she
cared for since childhood. Made me a huge fan of Andy Lau and Deannie
Yip. Lots of moving moments and slices of what life essentially is.</p>
<p><a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Departures_(film)">Departures</a>
(おくりびと)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtdENmR6jKw"
class="uri">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtdENmR6jKw</a></p>
<p>A failed cellist moves back to his home town to take a job of
preparing the dead for cremation ceremonies. Death is one of the best
subjects for a movie and Departures is loaded with symbolism. The
background score is full of beautiful cello tracks.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Wish_(film)">I Wish</a>
(奇跡)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05jKUWmgBQM"

<p>Discovering Japanese director Hirokazu Koreeda was one of the
highlights of this year. I loved I Wish so much, I ended up watching all
his movies. I cannot imagine how he gets children to act so naturally,
but they simply do in his movies. Here two brothers living in different
Japanese cities, due to their parents’ separation, make a journey to
meet midway. Left me all giddy with childhood memories.</p>
<p><a

Summer, Fall, Winter, and Spring</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoYjOF6NUm4"

<p>This has one of the most stunningly beautiful and tranquil settings
for a movie. Quite apt since you go through the cycle of life watching
someone grow from child to adult. Very meditative and a fantastic movie
to discuss with friends.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aandhi">Aandhi</a></p>
<p>I did not watch any movies growing up. So, I am going through old
Hindi gems at a glacial pace. A lot of good movies seem timeless. The
gender, family and social issues at the heart of Aandhi seem much more
relevant today than when it was made. And I do not even need to speak
about a few of the songs, they are just perfect.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Hours">Summer Hours</a>
(L’Heure d’été)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCkKPf7c76M"
class="uri">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCkKPf7c76M</a></p>
<p>Another movie with death, this one is in France. The children have to
decide what to do with their mother’s rural home and possessions after
she passes away. So many bright and happy memories are linked with the
place of our upbringing.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Late_Quartet">A Late
Quartet</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX66lRnNmqs"
class="uri">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX66lRnNmqs</a></p>
<p>Veteran actors, and yet they seem to be in their prime. Such good
performances.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kahaani">Kahaani</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1wEeuAosNM"
class="uri">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1wEeuAosNM</a></p>
<p>Thrilling plot, noisy and colorful Kolkata aptly matched by fine
acting by Vidya Balan, Nana and Nawaz.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Sonata">Tokyo Sonata</a>
(トウキョウソナタ)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyWp__jXNRw"
class="uri">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyWp__jXNRw</a></p>
<p>A Japanese salaryman’s family slowly implodes after he loses his job.
Top notch acting.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infernal_Affairs">Infernal
Affairs</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4R3nHkqyfM"

<p>Intense, nailbiting and intelligent. To this day, I feel queasy
thinking about the plight of the cop who is left no choice but to
continue his life of crime.</p>
<p>Martin Scorcese’s remake, The Departed, feels like utter junk once
you see the original. With the easy availability of subtitles today,
there is simply no reason to not watch the originals.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gattaca">Gattaca</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZppWok6SX88"

<p>In a future where your class is decided by your genes, one guy tries
to steal his way through the ranks. I do not need to stress the
parallels with current state of society.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hurt_Locker">Hurt
Locker</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GxSDZc8etg"
class="uri">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GxSDZc8etg</a></p>
<p>Totally raises the bar for any modern war movie. One of the most
edge-of-seat movies I’ve seen.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udaan_(2010_film)">Udaan</a>
(उड़ान)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2L_lVD7Xag"
class="uri">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2L_lVD7Xag</a></p>
<p>Despite its flaws, small town India and the frustrations of childhood
are well depicted. As a bonus, the songs turned out to be earworms.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Still_Walking_(film)">Still
Walking</a> (歩いても 歩いても)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gPbHqmjhNU"
class="uri">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gPbHqmjhNU</a></p>
<p>Another masterpiece from Hirokazu Koreeda. A happy family, but
underneath they’ve never forgotten the death of their elder son, who
drowned saving another kid. Family dynamics, the internal tensions,
emotions, feelings, the Asian way of expressing indirectly, all brought
out in perfection.</p>
<p><a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_People:_A_Year_in_the_Taiga">Happy
People: A Year in the Taiga</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1pOjj49d9Y"
class="uri">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1pOjj49d9Y</a></p>
<p>A documentary that follows one year in the life of fur trappers in
remote Siberia. The changing of seasons, the desolation and the
peace.</p>
<p>That is it! Hoping for another good year of movies in 2014 😊</p>
