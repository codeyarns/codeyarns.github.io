<p>My journey with <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moby-Dick"><strong>Moby
Dick</strong></a> began 3 decades ago, on Avenue Road in Chickpete,
Bangalore. It was one of those regular visits with my parents to pick up
used issues of <em>Chandamama</em> and Champak children’s magazines that
I was drawn to an illustrated pocket book of Moby Dick. Over countless
re-readings I would love this tale by <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_Melville"><strong>Herman
Melville</strong></a> and this pocket book form factor so much that I
would end up reading every one of the <a
href="https://lostinthecloudblog.com/2010/08/19/moby-books-illustrated-classic-editions/">Moby
Books Illustrated Classic Editions</a> I could lay my hand on.</p>
<p><em>“Call me Ishmael”</em>, that unforgettable line opens this novel,
with our narrator Ishmael answering his call to be on a ship by leaving
Manhattan and heading to Massachusetts. On a cold rainy night at the
<em>Spouter Inn</em> he meets the Pacific Islander <em>Queequeg</em>,
who would become his shipmate and harpooner later. This is one of the
best bromances in literature and they end up signing up for a 3-year
journey on the sperm whaling ship <em>Pequod</em>. Only after their
journey is well underway does their broody <em>Captain Ahab</em> show up
on deck, walking on a wooden leg and pumps up the crew to hunt and kill
Moby Dick, the white sperm whale that took his leg. This crew’s journey
around the world, killing sperm whales, meeting other ships that fought
Moby finally ends with their own faceoff against the whale from
hell.</p>
<p>Much like Ishmael I have felt the call to read the unabridged version
in the past few years. After many such attempts, which were abandoned
halfway due to the sheer size of this tome, I was finally able to see it
to the end during the year end vacations. My favorite part of this book
is the first act, where we see the friendship of Ishmael and Queequeg,
the detailed telling of Spouter Inn, the visit to the church and our
first introduction to Pequod and whaling. The middle act is especially
weak, but the pace quickens in the final act with the amazing pursuit of
Moby Dick. The later chapters read like plays, which I found to be not
as delicious to read as Ishmael’s narration.</p>
<p>At 820 pages, this is a massive book, but a third of the chapters are
just information about whales and whaling, which I found to be dull and
skipped. Minus that stuff, this is a great tale, almost biblical in the
telling. The writing is superlative, with many memorable lines worth
chewing over. I read an edition which had some nice Rockwell Kent
illustrations from 1958. Like most classics, this tome requires some
persistence but the reader is richly rewarded with an unforgettable
experience in exchange. There is simply no tale like this one and I felt
truly happy reliving my childhood memories.</p>

<h2 id="excerpts">Excerpts</h2>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a
damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily
pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every
funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand
of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from
deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking
people’s hats off—then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as
I can.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>That one most perilous and long voyage ended, only begins a second;
and a second ended, only begins a third, and so on, forever and for aye.
Such is the endlessness, yea, the intolerableness of all earthly
effort.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Well, well, my dear comrade and twin-brother, thought I, as I drew in
and then slacked off the rope to every swell of the sea—what matters it,
after all? Are you not the precious image of each and all of us men in
this whaling world? That unsounded ocean you gasp in, is Life; those
sharks, your foes; those spades, your friends; and what between sharks
and spades you are in a sad pickle and peril, poor lad.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>There is no folly of the beasts of the earth which is not infinitely
outdone by the madness of men.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>That though man loved his fellow, yet man is a moneymaking animal,
which propensity too often interferes with his benevolence.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>“Look ye, Nantucketer; here in this hand I hold his death! Tempered
in blood, and tempered by lightning are these barbs; and I swear to
temper them triply in that hot place behind the fin, where the White
Whale most feels his accursed life!”</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>“There she blows!—there she blows! A hump like a snow-hill! It is
Moby Dick!” only on page 781</p>
</blockquote></li>
