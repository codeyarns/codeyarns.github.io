<p>My journey with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moby-Dick"><strong>Moby Dick</strong></a> began 3 decades ago, on Avenue Road in Chickpete, Bangalore. It was one of those regular visits with my parents to pick up used issues of <em>Chandamama</em> and Champak children’s magazines that I was drawn to an illustrated pocket book of Moby Dick. Over countless re-readings I would love this tale by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_Melville"><strong>Herman Melville</strong></a> and this pocket book form factor so much that I would end up reading every one of the <a href="https://lostinthecloudblog.com/2010/08/19/moby-books-illustrated-classic-editions/">Moby Books Illustrated Classic Editions</a> I could lay my hand on.</p>
<p><em>“Call me Ishmael”</em>, that unforgettable line opens this novel, with our narrator Ishmael answering his call to be on a ship by leaving Manhattan and heading to Massachusetts. On a cold rainy night at the <em>Spouter Inn</em> he meets the Pacific Islander <em>Queequeg</em>, who would become his shipmate and harpooner later. This is one of the best bromances in literature and they end up signing up for a 3-year journey on the sperm whaling ship <em>Pequod</em>. Only after their journey is well underway does their broody <em>Captain Ahab</em> show up on deck, walking on a wooden leg and pumps up the crew to hunt and kill Moby Dick, the white sperm whale that took his leg. This crew’s journey around the world, killing sperm whales, meeting other ships that fought Moby finally ends with their own faceoff against the whale from hell.</p>
<p>Much like Ishmael I have felt the call to read the unabridged version in the past few years. After many such attempts, which were abandoned halfway due to the sheer size of this tome, I was finally able to see it to the end during the year end vacations. My favorite part of this book is the first act, where we see the friendship of Ishmael and Queequeg, the detailed telling of Spouter Inn, the visit to the church and our first introduction to Pequod and whaling. The middle act is especially weak, but the pace quickens in the final act with the amazing pursuit of Moby Dick. The later chapters read like plays, which I found to be not as delicious to read as Ishmael’s narration.</p>
<p>At 820 pages, this is a massive book, but a third of the chapters are just information about whales and whaling, which I found to be dull and skipped. Minus that stuff, this is a great tale, almost biblical in the telling. The writing is superlative, with many memorable lines worth chewing over. I read an edition which had some nice Rockwell Kent illustrations from 1958. Like most classics, this tome requires some persistence but the reader is richly rewarded with an unforgettable experience in exchange. There is simply no tale like this one and I felt truly happy reliving my childhood memories.</p>

<h2 id="excerpts">Excerpts</h2>
<ul>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people’s hats off—then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>That one most perilous and long voyage ended, only begins a second; and a second ended, only begins a third, and so on, forever and for aye. Such is the endlessness, yea, the intolerableness of all earthly effort.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>Well, well, my dear comrade and twin-brother, thought I, as I drew in and then slacked off the rope to every swell of the sea—what matters it, after all? Are you not the precious image of each and all of us men in this whaling world? That unsounded ocean you gasp in, is Life; those sharks, your foes; those spades, your friends; and what between sharks and spades you are in a sad pickle and peril, poor lad.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>There is no folly of the beasts of the earth which is not infinitely outdone by the madness of men.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>That though man loved his fellow, yet man is a moneymaking animal, which propensity too often interferes with his benevolence.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>“Look ye, Nantucketer; here in this hand I hold his death! Tempered in blood, and tempered by lightning are these barbs; and I swear to temper them triply in that hot place behind the fin, where the White Whale most feels his accursed life!”</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>“There she blows!—there she blows! A hump like a snow-hill! It is Moby Dick!” only on page 781</p>
