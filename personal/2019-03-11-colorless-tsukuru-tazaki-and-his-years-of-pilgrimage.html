<p>I must admit that I find finishing a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haruki_Murakami"><strong>Murakami</strong></a>
novel requires a bit of effort. I have started and given up on a couple
of them in the past year, but had no such trouble with <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorless_Tsukuru_Tazaki_and_His_Years_of_Pilgrimage"><strong>Colorless
Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage</strong></a>. This is a
translation to English by Philip Gabriel. In the novel, Tazaki was part
of a group of five close friends and this friendship was at the core of
his formative years in Nagoya. But one day after Tazaki moved to Tokyo
for college, the group completely rejected him without providing any
reason. It took many years for Tazaki to tide over the grief of this
separation. When he finally found a like-minded partner Sara, she
convinces him to visit his friends once again and find out why they
banished him.</p>
<p>Unlike <a
href="2015-04-12-the-wind-up-bird-chronicle.html"><strong>The Wind-Up
Bird Chronicle</strong></a>, there is very little of his fantasy or
magic realism here. I mean it is Murakami, so there are still some weird
dreams here and there, but the main plot sticks to the real world. I
loved the telling of memorable days in school and struggles to find
oneself in adult years. The reading experience quite reminded me of <a
href="2014-10-26-the-sense-of-an-ending.html"><strong>The Sense of an
Ending</strong></a>. Tazaki and his friends are fleshed out skillfully
and that makes it very easy to connect to one’s childhood years and
friends. Old crushes, unexplored affections, diverging interests in our
adult years, everything makes a beautiful and poignant appearance.</p>
<p>Murakami is known to be a huge classical music fan and much like his
other novels, he and his characters refer to a lot of classical music
here. Even the book’s title is a reference to a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann%C3%A9es_de_p%C3%A8lerinage">classical
music suite</a>. Since Tazaki designs train stations, I was hoping there
would be a lot of references to Japanese train stations and train
systems. Here I was left wanting because we are only thrown a tiny bone
about the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinjuku_Station"><strong>JR
Shinjuku Station</strong></a>, and that too at the end. If you are
looking to start on a Murakami, this novel might be easy to read and
straightforward to enjoy.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/4 (★★★★)</p>
<p><strong>Excerpts:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It’s the first thing I always say at our new employee training
seminars. I gaze around the room, pick one person, and have him stand
up. And this is what I say: I have some good news for you, and some bad
news. The bad news first. We’re going to have to rip off either your
fingernails or your toenails with pliers. I’m sorry, but it’s already
decided. It can’t be changed. I pull out a huge, scary pair of pliers
from my briefcase and show them to everybody. Slowly, making sure
everybody gets a good look. And then I say: Here’s the good news. You
have the freedom to choose which it’s going to be – your fingernails, or
your toenails. So, which will it be? You have ten seconds to make up
your mind. If you’re unable to decide, we’ll rip off both your
fingernails and your toenails. I start the count. At about eight seconds
most people say, ‘The toes.’ Okay, I say, toenails it is. I’ll use these
pliers to rip them off. But before I do, I’d like you to tell me
something. Why did you choose your toes and not your fingers? The person
usually says, ‘I don’t know. I think they probably hurt the same. But
since I had to choose one, I went with the toes.’ I turn to him and
warmly applaud him. And I say, Welcome to the real world.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Tsukuru wondered how much time people spend simply commuting to work
every day. Say the average commute was between an hour and an hour and a
half. That sounded about right. If your typical office worker, working
in Tokyo, married with a child or two, wanted to own his own house, the
only choice was to live in the suburbs and spend that much time getting
to work and back. So two to three hours out of every twenty-four would
be spent simply in the act of commuting. If you were lucky, you might be
able to read the newspaper or a paperback in the train. Maybe you could
listen to your iPod, to a Haydn symphony or a conversational Spanish
lesson. Some people might even close their eyes, lost in deep
metaphysical speculation. Still, it would be hard to call these two or
three hours rewarding, quality time. How much of one’s life was snatched
away to simply vanish as a result of this (most likely) pointless
movement from point A to point B? And how much did this effort exhaust
people, and wear them down?</p>
