<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 3/4 (Avatar is an alien world from the mind
of James Cameron that should be experienced.)</p>
<p>I have been extremely late in catching up with this year’s mega
blockbuster <strong><a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar_%282009_film%29">Avatar</a></strong>.
James Cameron returns from a long vacation with a fantastic new world
that has the potential to be another Star Wars series.</p>
<p>The story takes place on a planet called <strong>Pandora</strong>,
which the humans from Earth are mining for a metal called
<strong>Unobtainium</strong> (sic). In this metal quest, the humans have
run afoul of the <strong>Na’vi</strong>, the natives of Pandora. New
recruit Jake Scully is added to a secret research project which has
perfected a way to clone Na’vi bodies and control them using
telekinesis. Jake takes on his Na’vi form and starts mingling with the
Na’vi tribes to gain their trust and learn their secrets. Soon he is
falling in love with Neytiri, the daughter of the Na’vi chief and takes
their side. As expected, the lure of Unobtainium pushes the company to
use military force on the Na’vi, pitting Jake against them in an epic
battle.</p>
<p><strong>Avatar</strong> is a treat to watch and experience! The world
of Pandora itself is fantastic, James Cameron has convincingly created
an alien planet full of strange creatures and plants. Shot in stereo, it
looks nothing like the other movies claiming to be 3D this year. Sam
Worthington, Zoe Saldana and Sigourney Weaver have acted well. The
facial expressions of the Na’vi have been brought to screen very
realistically. Despite all this, the movie gets very predictable in the
second half, and the long battle does not help. Avatar is an alien world
that should to be experienced.</p>
