<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 3/4 (Avatar is an alien world from the mind of James Cameron that should be experienced.)</p>
<p>I have been extremely late in catching up with this year’s mega blockbuster <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar_%282009_film%29">Avatar</a></strong>. James Cameron returns from a long vacation with a fantastic new world that has the potential to be another Star Wars series.</p>
<p>The story takes place on a planet called <strong>Pandora</strong>, which the humans from Earth are mining for a metal called <strong>Unobtainium</strong> (sic). In this metal quest, the humans have run afoul of the <strong>Na’vi</strong>, the natives of Pandora. New recruit Jake Scully is added to a secret research project which has perfected a way to clone Na’vi bodies and control them using telekinesis. Jake takes on his Na’vi form and starts mingling with the Na’vi tribes to gain their trust and learn their secrets. Soon he is falling in love with Neytiri, the daughter of the Na’vi chief and takes their side. As expected, the lure of Unobtainium pushes the company to use military force on the Na’vi, pitting Jake against them in an epic battle.</p>
<p><strong>Avatar</strong> is a treat to watch and experience! The world of Pandora itself is fantastic, James Cameron has convincingly created an alien planet full of strange creatures and plants. Shot in stereo, it looks nothing like the other movies claiming to be 3D this year. Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana and Sigourney Weaver have acted well. The facial expressions of the Na’vi have been brought to screen very realistically. Despite all this, the movie gets very predictable in the second half, and the long battle does not help. Avatar is an alien world that should to be experienced.</p>
