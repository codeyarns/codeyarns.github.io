<p>The San Francisco Bay Area is full of parks and play areas that we have been quite enjoying for the past 4 years. The large number of parks of all sizes and features is probably one of the best features of this place. This is particularly important if you have kids (like we do) or if you are into outdoor activities.</p>
<p>This post is an attempt to capture a summary of the parks that we have experienced in this region.</p>
<h2 id="warm-springs-community-park-fremont">Warm Springs Community Park (Fremont)</h2>
<p>Located right next to the <strong>Warm Springs Community Center</strong> this is a small neighborhood park. It has a play structure area popular with kids and tennis courts. The route around it is nice to walk. There are toilets too.</p>
<p>We live nearby and we really like this park because it has the backdrop of the nearby hills behind it.</p>
<h2 id="live-oak-park-santa-clara"><a href="https://www.santaclaraca.gov/Home/Components/ServiceDirectory/ServiceDirectory/304/2654">Live Oak Park</a> (Santa Clara)</h2>
<p>This is a large neighborhood park surrounded by homes, a public school and the Northside Branch Library. It has a large area with play structures for kids. Folks also have picnics, birthday parties in the park.</p>
<p>The city also conducts evening movie screenings and other activities here. Some clubs also conduct their soccer and other sport camps here.</p>
<p>Also a great place to come and fly kites. And on certain evenings there are food trucks here and people sit around in camping chairs and having fun with food.</p>
<h2 id="thamien-park-santa-clara"><a href="https://www.santaclaraca.gov/Home/Components/ServiceDirectory/ServiceDirectory/291/2654">Thamien Park</a> (Santa Clara)</h2>
<p>We lived right next door to this small park for 4 years. Having a park so close was a huge advantage, since we could take our son out almost every single evening and weekend here.</p>
<p>This is a grassy park, has two play areas for smaller and older kids respectively. It also has toilets and a few round tables for having a eat out.</p>
<p>The play areas are always filled with kids in the evenings and weekends. The grass park is used by folks to play volleyball and soccer.</p>
<p>This park is also right next to the <strong>Guadalupe Creek Trail</strong> which is popular with folks who run and bike.</p>
