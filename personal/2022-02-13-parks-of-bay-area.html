<p>The San Francisco Bay Area is full of parks and play areas that we
have been quite enjoying for the past 4 years. The large number of parks
of all sizes and features is probably one of the best features of this
place. This is particularly important if you have kids (like we do) or
if you are into outdoor activities.</p>
<p>This post is an attempt to capture a summary of the parks that we
have experienced in this region.</p>
<h2 id="belgatos-park-los-gatos"><a
href="https://www.losgatosca.gov/900/Belgatos-Park">Belgatos Park</a>
(Los Gatos)</h2>
<p>This is a park with play structures and few picnic areas completely
under trees (so it can get chilly in the cold months) and a grassy open
area. Parking is available and if it is full, it is easy to park on the
nearby calm streets. Trails start from this park to head into the Heinz
Open Space Preserve and the Santa Rosa Open Space Preserve.</p>
<h2 id="lexington-reservoir-county-park-los-gatos"><a
href="https://parks.santaclaracounty.gov/locations/lexington-reservoir-county-park">Lexington
Reservoir County Park</a> (Los Gatos)</h2>
<p>This is huge park encircling the gigantic and serene Lexington
reservoir, on to the side of Highway 17. There are no picnic areas or
play structures here. Rather it is meant for fishing or launching
various kinds of boats to paddle in the reservoir. This park can also be
used as the starting point for the hiking trails into the St. Joseph’s
Hill Open Space Preserve. We parked at the lot near the Alma Bridge
entrance and hiked into the preserve.</p>
<h2 id="live-oak-park-santa-clara"><a
href="https://www.santaclaraca.gov/Home/Components/ServiceDirectory/ServiceDirectory/304/2654">Live
Oak Park</a> (Santa Clara)</h2>
<p>This is a large neighborhood park surrounded by homes, a public
school and the Northside Branch Library. It has a large area with play
structures for kids. Folks also have picnics, birthday parties in the
park.</p>
<p>The city also conducts evening movie screenings and other activities
here. Some clubs also conduct their soccer and other sport camps
here.</p>
<p>Also a great place to come and fly kites. And on certain evenings
there are food trucks here and people sit around in camping chairs and
having fun with food.</p>
<h2 id="oak-meadow-park-los-gatos"><a
href="https://www.losgatosca.gov/910/Oak-Meadow-Park">Oak Meadow
Park</a> (Los Gatos)</h2>
<p>This park has a few large-scale play structures of planes, trains and
fire trucks that kids can climb over, in addition to regular play
structures. There is a lot of free parking right in front of the play
area. It has many picnic areas and is popular for kids birthday parties.
This park has paths leading right into Vasona Lake County Park.</p>
<h2 id="thamien-park-santa-clara"><a
href="https://www.santaclaraca.gov/Home/Components/ServiceDirectory/ServiceDirectory/291/2654">Thamien
Park</a> (Santa Clara)</h2>
<p>We lived right next door to this small park for 4 years. Having a
park so close was a huge advantage, since we could take our son out
almost every single evening and weekend here.</p>
<p>This is a grassy park, has two play areas for smaller and older kids
respectively. It also has toilets and a few round tables for having a
eat out.</p>
<p>The play areas are always filled with kids in the evenings and
weekends. The grass park is used by folks to play volleyball and
soccer.</p>
<p>This park is also right next to the <strong>Guadalupe Creek
Trail</strong> which is popular with folks who run and bike.</p>
<h2 id="vasona-lake-county-park-los-gatos"><a
href="https://parks.sccgov.org/santa-clara-county-parks/vasona-lake-and-los-gatos-creek-county-parks">Vasona
Lake County Park</a> (Los Gatos)</h2>
<p>This is a huge county park with a big lake, a classic railroad, a
carousel, multiple picnic areas, multiple parking lots and a science
center.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.bjwrr.org/"><strong>Billy Jones Wildcat
Railroad</strong></a> is a must visit with kids in the Bay Area. They
have small versions of authentic steam engines pulling kids and adults
around the park. During special occasions like Christmas, the train and
the park are decorated with lights.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.bjwrr.org/"><strong>W. E. Bill Mason
Carousel</strong></a> is right next to the railroad station and is a
classic old carousel that is indoors. Another must try with kids.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.ysi-ca.org/"><strong>Youth Science Institute
(YSI)</strong></a> is located at the north end of the park and has its
own parking lot. It is worth a visit when at this park and kids can
easily spend about 15-30 minutes inside looking at the small animal/bird
exhibits. They have drawers filled with animal bones, skulls and paws
that are quite engaging.</p>
<p>There are lots of trails inside the park and also some that originate
in the park and extend into the surrounding regions.</p>
<h2 id="warm-springs-community-park-fremont"><a
href="https://www.fremont.gov/Home/Components/FacilityDirectory/FacilityDirectory/75/822?npage=2">Warm
Springs Community Park</a> (Fremont)</h2>
<p>Located right next to the <strong>Warm Springs Community
Center</strong> this is a small neighborhood park. It has a play
structure area popular with kids and tennis courts. The route around it
is nice to walk. There are toilets too.</p>
<p>We lived near here for a few years and we really like this park
because it has the backdrop of the nearby hills behind it.</p>
