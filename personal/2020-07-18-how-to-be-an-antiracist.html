<p>With Black Lives Matter protests rocking the USA, our bookclub chose this pertinent book by Ibram Kendi. In How to be an Antiracist, Kendi provides a thorough definition of racism and its history and causes, looks at it through a multitude of facets and then defines how to be an antiracist. Though racism in the US and casteism in India is all-pervasive, I must admit I had stayed away from reading books about it, since I had assumed these would be heavy reads.</p>
<p>In the book, the author recounts his life as a Black person from childhood to becoming a professor, while associating each stage with a different dimension of racism. Every chapter has clear definitions of what it means to be racist or antiracist in that dimension. The overall theme of the book is that being <em>not racist</em> is not enough, that is a mask for racism.</p>
<hr />
<p>The opposite of “racist” isn’t “not racist.” It is “antiracist.” What’s the difference? One endorses either the idea of a racial hierarchy as a racist, or racial equality as an antiracist. One either believes problems are rooted in groups of people, as a racist, or locates the roots of problems in power and policies, as an antiracist. One either allows racial inequities to persevere, as a racist, or confronts racial inequities, as an antiracist. There is no in-between safe space of “not racist.” The claim of “not racist” neutrality is a mask for racism.</p>
<p>I no longer care about how the actions of other Black individuals reflect on me, since none of us are race representatives, nor is any individual responsible for someone else’s racist ideas.</p>
<p>RACIST: One who is supporting a racist policy through their actions or inaction or expressing a racist idea. ANTIRACIST: One who is supporting an antiracist policy through their actions or expressing an antiracist idea.</p>
<p>Racism is a marriage of racist policies and racist ideas that produces and normalizes racial inequities.</p>
<p>“Racial discrimination” is an immediate and visible manifestation of an underlying racial policy. When someone discriminates against a person in a racial group, they are carrying out a policy or taking advantage of the lack of a protective policy. We all have the power to discriminate. Only an exclusive few have the power to make policy.</p>
<p>ASSIMILATIONIST: One who is expressing the racist idea that a racial group is culturally or behaviorally inferior and is supporting cultural or behavioral enrichment programs to develop that racial group. SEGREGATIONIST: One who is expressing the racist idea that a permanently inferior racial group can never be developed and is supporting policy that segregates away that racial group.</p>
<p>They entered the American middle class—a space then as now defined by its disproportionate White majority—and began to look at themselves and their people not only through their own eyes but also “through the eyes of others.”</p>
<p>Beginning in 1735, Carl Linnaeus locked in the racial hierarchy of humankind in Systema Naturae. He color-coded the races as White, Yellow, Red, and Black. He attached each race to one of the four regions of the world and described their characteristics. [...] At the bottom of the racial hierarchy, Linnaeus positioned Homo sapiens afer: “Sluggish, lazy. Black kinky hair. Silky skin. Flat nose. Thick lips. Females with genital flap and elongated breasts. Crafty, slow, careless. Covered by grease. Ruled by caprice.”</p>
<p>Scholars call what I saw a “microaggression,” a term coined by eminent Harvard psychiatrist Chester Pierce in 1970. Pierce employed the term to describe the constant verbal and nonverbal abuse racist White people unleash on Black people wherever we go, day after day. A White woman grabs her purse when a Black person sits next to her. The seat next to a Black person stays empty on a crowded bus.</p>
<p>He defines microaggressions as “brief, everyday exchanges that send denigrating messages to certain individuals because of their group membership.”</p>
<p>Biological racism rests on two ideas: that the races are meaningfully different in their biology and that these differences create a hierarchy of value.</p>
<p>One of racism’s harms is the way it falls on the unexceptional Black person who is asked to be extraordinary just to survive —and, even worse, the Black screwup who faces the abyss after one error, while the White screwup is handed second chances and empathy.</p>
<p>Because of the way the human mind works—the socalled “attribution effect,” which drive us to take personal credit for any success —those of us who prepped for the test would score higher and then walk into better opportunities thinking it was all about us: that we were better and smarter than the rest and we even had inarguable, quantifiable proof. Look at our scores!</p>
