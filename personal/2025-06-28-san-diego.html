<p><strong>San Diego</strong> is the 2nd largest city in California and
lies at the Southernmost tip of the state. We spend a week there at the
start of the kids summer break and they loved it.</p>
<h2 id="getting-there-and-back">Getting there and back</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>We decided to stay in Carlsbad (to the north of San Diego) and
the drive from Los Gatos to there was about 450 miles. To reduce dealing
with SF Bay Area traffic and LA traffic, we left early morning on a
Monday and returned back on Saturday.</p></li>
<li><p>The route is through Gilroy, getting on to I-5 near Los Banos,
staying on it all through Central Valley and then through Los Angeles.
This is at the limit of how much we can drive in a day with our kids and
without risking driver fatigue. We had to take 2-3 breaks along the way
for food and to let the kids have a stretch.</p></li>
<li><p>I-5 is infamous for having no good places to eat. That problem is
solved now - after leaving home early in the morning we found <a
href="https://www.harrisranch.com/">Harris Ranch Restaurant</a> to be a
great place to stop for breakfast. After crossing the Central Valley, we
stopped at Valencia Town Center for lunch.</p></li>
<li><p>On the way back, we had breakfast at our hotel and only stopped
for lunch by taking a slight detour to Bakersfield.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="things-to-do">Things to do</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Since we were going to be in San Diego for many days and planned
to visit many places, we found it economical to get the tickets to those
places using <a href="https://www.citypass.com/san-diego">City Pass</a>.
The tickets for everything mentioned below were bought using City Pass
and I could pull up the tickets on the City Pass app on the phone to be
scanned at the gates.</p></li>
<li><p>We spent a day at Legoland in Carlsbad. It was like a copy of
Disneyland, but catering to only young kids. Our kids were able to enjoy
almost all of the rides and attractions without requiring any extra
line-jumping fare. Our son loved all the 4 roller coasters. The Legoland
app on the phone was useful for figuring out the wait times and to find
our way through the theme park. I would recommend Legoland highly for
elementary and middle school age kids.</p></li>
<li><p>We spent a day at the San Diego Zoo. We started off by taking the
bus ride sitting on the top and getting a tour of the entire zoo. After
this we walked through the zoo the rest of the day checking out the
extensive collection of animals and birds. There were also some singing,
dance or athletic performances at different places in the zoo that were
entertaining. This zoo is quite big and has enough to fill a day, much
like the Singapore Zoo and I would recommend it.</p></li>
<li><p>We spent a day at Seaworld. This is a theme park with 2 big shows
of dolphins and orca whales and many extreme roller coasters. Our son
loved the Manta coaster and the BMX Blast performance with BMX bikes and
scooters. But we were disappointed to see that a few of the coasters
were closed on that day. There are some big play structures and a few
rides that very young kids will find to be fun. Seaworld has enough
entertainment for a day, but the food was not good (though it was
expensive) and the whole park looks a bit dated.</p></li>
<li><p>San Diego has lovely beaches. Unfortunately we were hampered by
clouds and cold winds and could not truly enjoy the beaches we visited
in Carlsbad.</p></li>
<li><p>We spent a day going around San Diego by using the <em>Old Town
Trolley Tours</em>. We parked the car in a lot near the USS Midway
Museum and caught the trolley near there. One of the stops we loved was
the Coronado island, we would love to visit it again. Another stop was
Little Italy, where we had lunch. After returning from the tour, we
caught a <em>City Cruises</em> cruise ship that took us on the sea
around the San Diego bay, showing us the Coronado island and the
extensive military and naval bases and the ships and helicopters that
make San Diego home.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We loved San Diego, easily one of the best places we have visited in
the US and a perfect place to visit with kids.</p>
