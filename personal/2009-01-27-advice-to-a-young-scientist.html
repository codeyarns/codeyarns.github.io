<p>Advice To A Young Scientist is a book by <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Medawar">P. B. Medawar</a> for
folks keen on entering research. Medawar won the Nobel Prize for
Medicine in 1960 for his research on why immune systems reject organ
transplants. Medawar’s writing is meticulous and a joy to read. Though
the former half of the book deals with practical information for the
newbie, the latter turns into a treatise on science and the scientific
method. Not bad reading at all.</p>
<p>Excerpts from the book:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this book I interpret “science” pretty broadly to refer to all
exploratory activities of which the purpose is to come to a better
understanding of the natural world. This exploratory activity is called
“research,” and research is my chief topic, although it is only a small
fraction of the multitude of scientific or science-based activities,
(which include scientific administration, scientific journalism which
grows in importance with science itself), the teaching of science, the
supervision and often the execution of many industrial procedures
[…]</p>
<hr />
<p>People who believe themselves cut out for a scientific life are
sometimes dismayed and depressed by, in Sir Francis Bacon’s words, “The
subtilty of nature, the secret recesses of truth, the obscurity of
things, the difficulty of experiment, the implication of causes and the
infirmity of man’s discerning power, being men no longer excited, either
out of desire or hope, to penetrate farther.”</p>
<hr />
<p>A novice must stick it out until he discovers whether the rewards and
compensations of a scientific life are for him commensurate with the
disappointments and the toil; but if once a scientist experiences the
exhilaration of discovery and the satisfaction of carrying through a
really tricky experiment — once he has felt that deeper and more
expansive feeling Freud has called the “oceanic feeling” that is the
reward for any real advancement of the understanding — then he is hooked
and no other kind of life will do.</p>
<hr />
<p>[…] experimentation is a form of thinking as well as a practical
expression of thought.</p>
<hr />
<p>It can be said with complete confidence that any scientist of any age
who wants to make important discoveries must study important
problems.</p>
<hr />
<p>After graduate students have taken their Ph.D.s, they must on no
account continue with their Ph.D. work for the remainder of their lives,
easy and tempting though it is to tie up loose ends and wander down
attractive byways. Many successful scientists try their hands at a great
many different things before they settle upon a main line of
investigation […]</p>
<hr />
<p>The great incentive to learning a new skill or supporting discipline
is an urgent need to use it. For this reason, very many scientists (I
certainly among them) do not learn new skills or master new disciplines
until the pressure is upon them to do so; thereupon they can be mastered
pretty quickly. It is the lack of this pressure on those who are forever
“equipping themselves” and who show an ominous tendency to become
“night-class habitues” […]</p>
<hr />
<p>Too much book learning may crab and confine the imagination, and
endless poring over the research of others is sometimes psychologically
a research substitute, much as reading romantic fiction may be a
substitute for real-life romance.</p>
<hr />
<p>Following the lead of Bismarck and Cavour, who described the art of
politics as “the art of the possible,” I have described the art of
research as “the art of the soluble.” […] What I meant of course was
that the art of research is that of making a problem soluble by finding
out ways of getting at it — soft underbellies and the like.</p>
<hr />
<p>Scientists will certainly encounter and must work out some suitable
means for rebutting the notion that, so far from trying to better the
lot of mankind, the outcome of their work is to devalue much of what
ordinary folk hold dear. Through science, you may hear, art has been
replaced by artifice: portraiture by photography, live music by Muzak,
good food by processed substitutes, and the old-fashioned crusty loaf by
a chemically bleached or otherwise “improved,” devitaminized,
revitaminized, steam-baked, presliced parallelepiped in a polyethylene
shroud.</p>
<hr />
<p>I cannot give any scientist of any age better advice than this: the
intensity of the conviction that a hypothesis is true has no bearing on
whether it is true or not.</p>
<hr />
<p>Problems to do with priority are especially acute in science because
scientific ideas must eventually become public property, so that the
only sense of ownership a scientist can ever enjoy is that of having
been the first to have an idea — to have hit upon a solution or the
solution before anyone else.</p>
<hr />
<p>A scientist who is too cagey or suspicious to tell his colleagues
anything will soon find that he himself learns nothing in return. G. F.
Kettering, the well-known inventor (antiknock gasoline additives) and
cofounder of General Motors, is said to have remarked that anyone who
shuts his door keeps out more than he lets out. The agreed house rule of
the little group of close colleagues I have always worked with has
always been “Tell everyone everything you know”; and I don’t know anyone
who came to any harm by falling in with it.</p>
<hr />
<p>Such a class distinction is particularly offensive because it is
based upon a complete misconception of the original meaning of the word
pure — the meaning that was thought to confer a loftier status upon pure
than upon applied science. The word was originally used to distinguish a
science of which the axioms or first principles were known not through
observation or experiment — vulgar activities both — but through pure
intuition, revelation, or a certain quality of self-evidence.</p>
<hr />
<p>How often has it not been contemptuously said that “modern medicine
cannot even cure the common cold”? What is offensive here is not the
statement’s falsity (it is true) but its implication: is it not
pointless to pour billions of dollars into cancer research when modern
medicine… and so on. What is wrong here is the almost universally held
belief that clinically mild diseases have simple causes while grave
diseases are deeply complex and are proportionately difficult to discern
the causes of or to cure. There is no truth in either; a common cold,
caused by one or more of a multiplicity of upper respiratory viruses and
with an overlay of allergic reactivity, is an extremely complex ailment;
so is eczema, most forms of which are baffling still. On the other hand,
some very grave diseases such as phenylketonuria have relatively simple
origins; some can be prevented, as phenylketonuria can be, or cured, as
so many bacterial infections can be.</p>
<hr />
<p>Harriet Zucker-man has shown in Scientific Elite, her study of
American Nobel laureates, that in relation to the population “at risk,”
as actuaries say — at risk of making a contribution to science — the
modal age at which laureates did the work that won them their prizes was
early middle age.</p>
<hr />
<p>[…] people with anything to say can usually say it briefly; only a
speaker with nothing to say goes on and on as if he were laying down a
smoke screen.</p>
<hr />
<p>[…] an experiment is a contrived, as opposed to a natural, experience
or happening — is the consequence of “trying things out” or even of
merely messing about.</p>
<hr />
<p>A young scientist has now a meter or so of bench space, let us say, a
white coat, authority to use the library, and a problem that he has
thought up himself or that a senior has asked him to look into. To begin
with, anyway, it is almost certain to be a small problem — one of which
the solution will facilitate the solution of something more important,
and so on, until the long-term objective of the enterprise is in sight.
Nonscientists cannot immediately see the connection between the lesser
problem and the greater.</p>
<hr />
<p>Thus the day-to-day business of science consists not in hunting for
facts but in testing hypotheses — that is, ascertaining if they or their
logical implications are statements about real life or, if inventions,
to see whether or not they work.</p>
<hr />
A large part of the art of the soluble is the art of devising hypotheses
that can be tested by practicable experiments.
