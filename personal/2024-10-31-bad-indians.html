<p><strong>Bad Indians</strong> is the memoir of a half-white
half-Indian (Native American) filled with musings about her family to
mirror to the history and plight of California Indians. <em>Deby</em>
(Deborah Miranda) starts off the quiet rage with the arrival of the
Franciscan missionaries to California. The <em>padres</em> (fathers) see
the soft California Indians as savages and using the power of the
Spanish soldiers create <em>missions</em> where the Indians are enslaved
together to grow food and live a strict life. Scores die due to diseases
brought over from the Old World to which Indians have low resistance.
After securalization, the missions disappear leaving behind Indians who
have lost their stories, language, customs, religion and fashion.
Further tragedy awaits them when they are hunted and sold as slaves
during the period of California’s gold rush. In the latter half of the
book which deals with the past century, the focus is on the author’s
great grandparents down to her own neglective and abusive parents and
their lives as Indians.</p>
<p>The book is a loosely ordered mosaic of biographical, historical and
poetic writings. There is a quiet rage bubbling in every piece about the
centuries of exploitation and how this history has ill-prepared Indians
for facing the world today. The author is highly evocative in her poems,
dreamy stories and tales of her family. There is a lot of repetition
among the essays, like the California <em>4th grade school project about
missions</em> which whitewashes the atrocities of the padres and the
suffering of the Indians at the missions. Unsettling to me was the
domestic violence of the author’s dad and her acceptance of her dad’s
behavior as the product of centuries of exploitation. Some of the
writing is confusing as it is difficult to discern fiction from fact.
This is an intense and well researched book which could do with less
detail of her parents and a cleanup of the repetition and chronological
ordering.</p>
<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 3/5</p>
