<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 2/4 (A watchable emotional sports drama set
in the Christian South.)</p>
<p>There are some American movies which I think I will never be able to
understand or empathize with. <strong><a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blind_Side_%28film%29">The Blind
Side</a></strong> for example, which I watched recently at a screening
at the university. The movie is a 2009 sports-drama, starring Sandra
Bullock and Quinton Aaron. Oher (Quinton) is a 16-year old giant of an
African-American who seems to have slipped through the cracks of
American society. With some luck he ends up at a Christian school, but
with no prior schooling he seems to be losing even this tiny sliver of
hope. This is when he is discovered by Anne (Sandra Bullock) who takes
him into her own family and helps him chart out his career. With her
dogged determination and help from his teachers, coach and a private
tutor Oher scores his grades and becomes a football star.</p>
<p>The movie is based on the real life story of <strong><a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Oher">Michael
Oher</a></strong> published as the book <strong>The Blind Side:
Evolution of a Game</strong>. The Blind Side is well made, though a tad
too long. Both Quinton and Sandra Bullock are pretty convincing, though
it takes a while to believe Bullock is a devout Christian with a
Southern accent. The movie tries to evoke the viewer’s empathy, but
somehow I could never come around to that. I could not see why this one
kid should get all this Christian goodwill while most of his friends
wander the street with neither an education nor careers! The movie won a
slew of awards, including the Best Actress Oscar for Sandra Bullock,
which is again quite head-scratching. In any case, The Blind Case is a
watchable emotional sports drama set in the Christian South.</p>
