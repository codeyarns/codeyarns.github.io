<p>Most people in the US have been feeling angry for a few years now.
The book <a
href="https://cup.columbia.edu/book/angrynomics/9781788212793"><strong>Angrynomics</strong></a>
tries to explore the relation between economics and this public anger.
It is presented as 5 dialogues between the 2 authors Eric Lonergan and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Blyth"><strong>Mark
Blyth</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Dialogues 1 and 2 are kind of vague and explore different kinds of
public anger. Dialogue 3 is a history of capitalism from the point of
view of the authors. We begin with the relationship between
<em>capital</em> and <em>labor</em>. They observe that though capitalism
treats labor as just another commodity, it is actually different because
labor has opinions. They define 1800s-1945 as <em>Capitalism 1.0</em>
where capital could move freely between nations and labor did not have a
voice. After WW2, the years 1945-1980 was <em>Capitalism 2.0</em> where
labor unionized and got bargaining power in spreading the profits of
capitalism to more of the population. In the US and most developed
nations, this was the period with high taxes for the wealthy, and lifted
most people into middle class, with increasing access to inexpensive
housing, education and healthcare. After 1980 to the present day is
<em>Capitalism 3.0</em> where central banks took over and made keeping
inflation low as the top priority, unions lost power and income
inequality increased. In the final dialogue, the authors try to provide
3 solutions for <em>Capitalism 4.0</em>: creating a national wealth fund
(NWF) so all citizens get a pie of the stock market growth, dual
interest rates and a universal basic income based on licensing data to
tech companies.</p>
<p>Though published in 2020, the topic of the book seems even more
timely today. However, I did not really like the use of dialogue to
discuss this topic. In my opinion, the first 2 dialogues examining types
of anger really had no place in this book. And in the rest, there was no
real direction, structure or depth, seeming more like a casual chat on a
podcast. The author use the analogy of different kinds of computers
(Apple vs.¬†Microsoft), software and bug fixes to explain the differences
in the economic systems of US, Germany and other nations. There is a lot
of repetition that people‚Äôs anger has not been addressed by centrist
politicians with their small <em>bug fix</em> solutions, but that it
requires big drastic change. So it is quite funny to see the authors
themselves proposing 3 ‚Äúlets not rock the boat‚Äù bug-fix solutions at the
end of the book.</p>
<p>Since I read the FT (where Eric is a contributor), The Economist and
The Atlantic, all the anecdotes and hypotheses the authors presented
were already familiar to me, thus diminishing their impact. I was hoping
that there would be data, plots and statistics, but there is none of
that in the book. It was also ironic to read about economic inequality
and public anger from an author (Eric) who is a hedge-fund manager!
Another fundamental problem with the book is that they ignore that a lot
of the anger is not from economics, but has been fomented by mass media
and social media algorithms in the pursuit of more eyeballs. This book
was a quick read (150 pages of actual content), but an easily
forgettable one, that could have really benefited from a clear structure
and lots of real economic insights and depth.</p>
<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 3/5</p>
