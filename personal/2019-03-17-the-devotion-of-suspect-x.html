<p>A divorced mom <strong>Yasuko</strong> and her daughter
<strong>Misato</strong> are harassed by her ex-husband, they knock him
down and kill him in a fit of anger. A math genius neighbor
<strong>Ishigami</strong>, who has a secret crush on the mom, steps in
to help the conceal the murder. The body of the ex appears beside a
faraway riverside the next day with the face smashed in and fingerprints
burnt off. The police are clueless until a physics genius
<strong>Yukawa</strong> takes interest in the case. What follows is a
brilliant chess game, for every hole that Yukawa uncovers it turns out
that Ishigami had already planned for it way back when he concealed the
murder. How did he do that?</p>
<p>I had just recently enjoyed another <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keigo_Higashino"><strong>Keigo
Higashino</strong></a> novel <a
href="2019-02-10-the-name-of-the-game-is-a-kidnapping.html">The Name of
the Game is a Kidnapping</a>. On the suggestion of AK I picked up <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Devotion_of_Suspect_X"><strong>The
Devotion of Suspect X</strong></a> after that. I expected another
delicious caper. But this one went beyond expectations to be the most
intelligent murder mystery I have ever read!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When an amateur attempts to conceal something, the more complex he
makes his camouflage, the deeper the grave he digs for himself. But not
so a genius. The genius does something far simpler, yet something no
normal person would even dream of, the last thing a normal person would
think of doing. And from this simplicity, immense complexity is
created.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the reader, the only thing you know more than the police is the
true identity of the victim and the culprits. Ishigami’s game is top
notch, having thought of every possible loophole ahead of time. As the
reader and the police discover one weakness after another, we are only
shocked to discover that it was expected to be discovered and cannot
understand how he did it. Higashino builds such a watertight plot that I
could not figure out anything until the moment he would choose to show
his hand. What results is a nail-biting experience. Two final puzzle
pieces late into the novel finally let us understand Ishigami’s genius
and maniac nature. The first piece is gory and was something I had been
suspecting all along. But the second piece was pure genius and turns
your entire hypothesis upside down. A story that is no less than a
brilliant magic act.</p>
<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 5/5</p>
