<p>I quite enjoyed the movie <strong>Arrival</strong> and so naturally
ended up picking up <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stories_of_Your_Life_and_Others"><strong>Stories
of Your Life and Others</strong></a>. Written by <strong>Ted
Chiang</strong>, this book of 8 science fiction short stories is now
rebranded as Arrival, to cash in on the movie’s success. These stories
were published over a decade between 1990 and 2002 and appear in the
book in published order. After first reading them in 2018, I got a
chance again in 2020 to read them for a bookclub.</p>
<p><strong>The Tower of Babylon</strong> is a perfect example of what
Ted Chiang does best. In what the author calls <em>Babylonian science
fiction</em> in his speaker notes, it deftly combines reality, myth and
science. If there was a tower being built from the Earth’s surface up to
Heaven, it shows the logistics of moving materials, food and people and
the social life for folks living on the higher levels of the enormous
tower. In the end, the miners reach the top and break it reappearing
back at a different place on Earth, indicating that the Earth is shaped
like a cylinder or a Mobius strip of some sort. The ending is weak, but
I loved the rest.</p>
<p><strong>Understand</strong> is the author’s first published short. It
reads more like a sci-fi action thriller where a person gains superhuman
intelligence due to a Harmone K treatment. The FBI is hunting him, but
using his super intelligence he is able to evade them easily and also
study and understand all of human knowledge. He soon discovers that he
has an equally potent adversary - another human who also got the harmone
treatment. The duel of their minds is the climax, which again is a bit
weak after a strong two acts.</p>
<p><strong>Division by Zero</strong>, surrounds a mathematician’s lament
on discovering the shaky foundations of math and her partner’s attempts
to support her. I felt that this was the weakest story in the
collection.</p>
<p><strong>The Story of Your life</strong> is the short that was turned
into a successful movie. Aliens have arrived in Earth and are trying to
converse with humans. The story revolves around a linguisitics
professor’s successful attempts at spoken communication and later
written communication with the beings. To write in the alien’s script
requires one to understand both the past and future of what is being
communicated. Essentially, one can see both the past and the future of
what you are trying to communicate once you learn the script. Chiang
could have stopped there, but he beautifully meshes that to a letter
from the mother to her (unborn) daughter of this experience and of her
own (future) life. I got a whole new respect for this story on the
second read. It is a complex and interesting idea, that Chiang is able
to pull off. The movie turns out to be interesting in its own way, but
it goes in a different direction.</p>
<p>Themes of genetics and robotics combine in <strong>Seventy-Two
Letters</strong> which introduces a fantasy world set in the 18th
century. It is a world where <em>names</em> are used to bring life to
automatons and humans have just discovered that they have only a few
generations left before extinction. The people trying to save the human
race are using <em>nomenclature</em> to impress names into ovum to
continue human reproduction.</p>
<p>In <strong>Hell is the absence of God</strong>, Chiang cleverly
shifts our current world reality, just a wee little bit. It is a world
where visitations by angels and the miracles that happen due to that are
akin to natural disasters, leaving people blind or paralyzed due to the
energy those acts unleash. The short uses that to question the religious
belief that being punished is also a gift of God.</p>
<p><strong>Liking what you see: A documentary</strong> introduces
<em>calliagnosia</em>, a way to induce brain neurons to be immune to
facial beauty. The short uses that to debate the importance of beauty in
our world, how beauty is used as a tool to attract and market.</p>
<p>Ted Chiang proves to be exceptional in presenting intriguing new
ideas in meticulous fictional detail, these are sure to expand your
thinking. Where I found the stories lacking was the human elements. In
some shorts, the combination of elements are perfect, but in some the
human parts of the story suffer. I think this is a good book to read and
a better book to discuss with friends.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 3/4</p>
