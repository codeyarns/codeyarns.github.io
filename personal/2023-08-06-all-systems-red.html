<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Systems_Red"><strong>All
Systems Red</strong></a> is the first sci-fi novella in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Murderbot_Diaries"><strong>The
Murderbot Diaries</strong></a> series. Written by <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha_Wells"><strong>Martha
Wells</strong></a> these books center around a security cyborg named
<em>Murderbot</em>.</p>
<p>We start off on a desolate alien planet being explored by a group of
scientists called the Preservation led by Dr. Mensah. Protecting them
from the hostile fauna of the planet is a SecUnit named Murderbot. What
the humans do not realize is that the Murderbot has a faulty governor
module, essentially meaning that it has started to think for itself. The
expedition starts discovering anomalies in the survey maps of the
planet, the satellite connection goes silent and the second expedition
on the planet DeltFall is unresponsive. When they travel over to the
DeltFall site, they discover that all humans have been killed and are
attacked by their SecUnits. This is when they realize that there is a
malicious third expedition on the planet who have discovered something
valuable and are ready to kill everyone else to profit from it.</p>
<p>This was a fast and short read, and can easily be finished in one
sitting. Wells succeeds in creating sci-fi-lite, just enough interesting
details to keep the story intelligent. The novella is narrated by
Murderbot and at the end of the book it gets its freedom from Dr. Mensah
and chooses to roam free among planets.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 3/4</p>
