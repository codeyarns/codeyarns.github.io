<p>I was positively salivating at the premise that <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_H._Winters"><strong>Ben
Winters</strong></a> cooks up in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Policeman"><strong>The Last
Policeman</strong></a>. An asteroid is hurtling towards Earth, collision
is imminent in a few months and humanity is living out their final days.
Everybody in the police force has lost interest in solving crime, except
our detective <em>Hank Palace</em> who suspects that his most recent
suicide case is a homicide. It takes the rest of the novel for him to
prove it, while everybody around him are questioning <em>why does it
even matter</em> to solve a crime when Earth is doomed.</p>
<p>Our victim is a <em>Peter Zell</em>, an insurance company actuary,
who seems to have killed himself in a McDonald’s bathroom. Hank cannot
find a motive for the suicide, while he starts finding evidence that
maybe Zell was killed for something he discovered at his job. His
bumbling detective colleagues and boss at the police station are no real
help. While the interviews with Zell’s boss and his secretary lead
nowhere. Zell’s sister, who works at the hospital, is suspiciously
aloof. And distracting his focus on the case is his own sister
<em>Nico</em>, whose boyfriend has apparently gone AWOL at a military
base.</p>
<p>I truly loved the premise, this setup is perfect for a great TV
series. However, the execution of the plot comes nowhere close to the
vision. All the characters are uniformly forgettable, you close the book
and no one comes to mind. The plot, though interesting in the beginning,
loses steam by the middle, since the clues come way too slowly and
nothing interesting really happens to keep the momentum going. And when
the final reveal of the murderer happens, I was left unimpressed. This
book is the first of a trio (and apparently it gets better), but I have
no buzz left to pursue this series.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 3/5</p>
