<p>Having not read any Russian classic before I jumped on the chance to read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Master_and_Margarita"><strong>The Master and Margarita</strong></a> when it came along. This book written by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Bulgakov"><strong>Mikhail Bulgakov</strong></a> appears highly recommended among Russian works. I read the edition translated by Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky and apparently it is a decent one.</p>
<p>The story begins in Moscow with the appearance of the devil <em>Woland</em> and his entourage which includes Koroviev, Azazello, Hella and a black cat named Behemoth. Woland informs an editor Berlioz the exact manner of how he would die in an accident in a short while. That tragic death of Berlioz witnessed by his minion Ivan Homeless and the subsequent acts of Woland and his gang in the city create the stage for an incredible showpiece of dark comedy set amidst the Soviet system.</p>
<p>The essential plot of the book takes us through the various characters in Moscow who are affected by Woland’s antics. First the people at the residence of Moscow Literary Society (aka Masolit aka Griboedev’s house) of which Berlioz was the head have to deal with his ununsual death. Then the head honchos at the Variety Theatre deal with the aftermath of the Woland gang performing a black magic show where they essentially shower the Moscovites with money, shoes and dresses. Finally, the communal apartment dwellers at Berlioz’s apartment complex are also at the receiving end of some subterfuge.</p>
<p>The <em>Master</em> of the book is an author who has been writing a Biblical account of Jesus’s final days and the Roman general Pontius Pilate tasked with his punishment. The Biblical chapters we are reading are essentially excerpts from the master’s book. And <em>Margarita</em> happens to be his infatuated lover, who is made a magical witch by Woland so that she can entertain at the Satan’s ball. As a reward she is reunited back with her master. The book ends with the citizens and police of Moscow being in utter confusion due to Woland’s tricks and his entourage takes leave after setting fire to all the places they touched.</p>
<p>I loved the satire of the Soviet life in this book. Being new to this landscape, poets/writers/artists being officially employed by the government, the life of communal apartments and their primus stoves in the kitchen, the illegality of foreign currency, people <em>disappearing</em> once they were taken by the secret police and many other aspects of Soviet culture were truly interesting to read. Satan and his gang playing with the powers to be in this city is a delight to watch. However, the Biblical chapters and Margarita’s fantasy as a witch were not very interesting to me and did not seem essential to the book. The book could have been half the length without those contents and would have been a superb tight Soviet satire.</p>
