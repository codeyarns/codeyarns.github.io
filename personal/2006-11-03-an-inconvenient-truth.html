<p>[ <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/paramount_classics/aninconvenienttruth/">Trailer</a> ]</p>
<p><em>“… we are entering a period of consequences.”</em> — Winston Churchill</p>
<p>Months after its release in USA, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0497116/">An Inconvenient Truth</a> opened recently in SG. I’d been eagerly waiting to watch it. This documentary on global warming stars Al Gore and is directed by Davis Guggenheim. It is mostly recorded from Al Gore’s presentation on the issue which he has been giving all around the world. This is interspersed with important moments from Al Gore’s life which caused him to take this cause of saving the planet.</p>
<p>The figures and graphs from the movie are really shocking and depressing. The movie is full of breathtaking scenes of nature from around the world. Al Gore comes across as an erudite and well spoken person, like a really good professor talking to his students. You might become his fan after the movie. (Americans chose Bush over <em>this</em> guy?!) His presentations are really slick (made with <a href="http://www.apple.com/iwork/keynote/">Keynote</a> I presume) and so is the way the story is told. BTW you will surely notice that Al Gore is an Apple fan. He is always seen working on his Apple laptop.</p>
<p>The premise of the movie is that global warming is real and is happening right now. We’re already seeing its effects (Mumbai rains, Katrina, etc.) and the next decade is going to get only worse. Very worse. Worse enough to affect tens of millions of people in coastal areas. We have caused it and we can prevent it, if we act now. You can find out more at the movie’s website <a href="http://www.climatecrisis.net/">www.climatecrisis.net</a>. Here in SG, the <em><a href="http://www.eco-singapore.org/campaign/ait/">Campaign 4 An Inconvenient Truth</a></em> is trying to interest people to watch this movie and take action. IMO this is a movie that needs to be seen by everyone.</p>
