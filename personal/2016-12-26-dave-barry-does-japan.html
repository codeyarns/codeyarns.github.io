mentally and physically demanding, having to learn to live with a tiny
human, is drawing to a close. Not surprisingly, I turned to humor to
lighten my mind by picking up <strong>Dave Barry Does
Japan</strong>.</p>
<p><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Barry"><strong>Barry</strong></a>
visited Japan with his wife and son for a few weeks way back in 1991,
the Bush Senior years, if that helps jog your memory. This book is an
observation of the differences between American and Japanese cultures
from his point of view. Almost everything imaginable is covered from
language to food to sports to society. I was snickering and laughing on
every page, with the chapter on Kabuki theater having me in the biggest
splits.</p>
<p>Barry is the funniest contemporary writer I have come across and this
book does not disappoint. I am amazed how he can see what we see and yet
give that examination such a fun innovative spin and generate such
excellent wordplay that leaves one chuckling and laughing. In my book,
that is just as impressive a skill as the serious writing that wins
those serious literature awards. I can easily recommend this book to
lighten your spirits anytime. If there is one complaint, it is that this
book is way too short compared to his other books and he could have
covered way more Japanese idiosyncrasies in far more detail. If this
year is any indicator of how 2017 will be, I will surely be hitting the
humor shelves more often in the coming months.</p>
