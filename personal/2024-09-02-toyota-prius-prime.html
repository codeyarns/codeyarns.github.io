<p>We recently got a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Prius_Plug-in_Hybrid"><strong>Toyota
Prius Prime</strong></a>, 2024 XSE edition, for our family. This post is
an attempt to note the various features, jargon and technologies
associated with this vehicle.</p>
<h2 id="regular-features">Regular features</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Shift position</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>P: Press the P button to park the vehicle.</li>
<li>D: Shift to this to drive. This is also the most fuel efficient
shift position since it uses regenerative braking automatically when the
brake is pressed.</li>
<li>R: To reverse the car.</li>
<li>B: Uses strong braking whenever accelerator is released. To be used
on steep hills. Note that this is <em>not</em> the regenerative braking
mode.</li>
<li>N: Neutral</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Driving Modes</strong>: Different driving modes can be
chosen using the Drive Mode select switch by the driver’s right side.
Supported modes are Normal, Eco, Sport and Custom.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Parking brake (manual)</strong>: Pull the <em>(P)</em>
switch to set it. Press the <em>(P)</em> switch or press accelerator
pedal to release the brake.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Parking brake (automatic)</strong>: In automatic mode,
the car sets the parking brake automatically when shifted to <em>P</em>.
To turn ON this mode, pull and hold the <em>(P)</em> switch until a
buzzer sounds. To turn OFF this mode, keep brake pressed and press down
on the <em>(P)</em> switch until a buzzer sounds.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="driving-assist-features">Driving assist features</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Lane Change Assist (LCA)</p></li>
<li><p>Lane Tracing Assist (LTA)</p></li>
<li><p>Lane Departure Alert (LDA)</p></li>
<li><p>Proactive Driving Assist (PDA)</p></li>
<li><p>Front Cross Traffic Alert (FCTA)</p></li>
<li><p>Road Sign Assist (RSA)</p></li>
<li><p>Dynamic Radar Cruise Control (DRCC)</p></li>
<li><p>Driver Monitor Camera (DMC)</p></li>
<li><p>Traffic Jam Assist (TJA)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Blind Spot Monitor (BSM)</strong>: Indicates to the
driver if there are vehicles in the blind spot and it is not safe to
change lanes. The driver is informed by illuminating the indicators on
the outside rear view mirrors and a buzzing sound. This feature uses
radar sensors installed on the left/right corners of the rear
bumper.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lane Departure Alert (LDA)</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Safe Exit Assist (SEA)</strong>: Indicates to the driver
if there are vehicles in the blind spot and it is not safe to open the
door. When the driver opens a door, they are informed by illuminating
the indicators on the outside rear view mirrors and a buzzing sound.
This feature uses radar sensors installed on the left/right corners of
the rear bumper.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Intuitive Parking Assist (IPA)</strong>: Shows the
proximity of wall/objects to the car when parking the car. This is
displayed on the multimedia display and also with a buzzing sound. This
feature uses sensors on the front corners and rear corners.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rear Cross Traffic Alert (RCTA)</strong>: When backing
out of a parking spot, this uses the rear camera display to warn if
there are vehicles crossing from the sides at the back of the car. This
feature uses the rear side sensors.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rear Camera Detection (RCD)</strong>: Detects pedestrians
right behind the vehicle. Sounds a buzzer and displays on multimedia
display. This feature uses the rear camera (not the sensors).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>ParKing Support Brake (PKSB)</strong>: My car does not
have this feature.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Toyota Teammate Advanced Park</strong>: My car does not
have this feature.</p></li>

<h2 id="incident-1-oct-2024">Incident 1 (Oct 2024)</h2>
<h3 id="day-1">Day 1</h3>
<p>I could not avoid hitting a fist-sized stone with my front-left tire
while accelerating to freeway speed at the end of the on-ramp. The
multi-information display immediately sounded and displayed a huge
warning of extremely low pressure in that tire. While driving a bit more
to assess the situation, I noticed that every half a mile the tire had
the feel of going over something. I slowly exited the freeway with the
hazard lights ON and parked in the nearest parking lot.</p>
<p>I called <em>Toyota Roadside Assistance</em> since the car was still
under the Toyota Plus coverage. After providing the VIN number, which is
displayed on the front-right outside, a tow truck was assigned to me. I
noted that Toyota Roadside Assistance outsources to AAA which assigned a
tow truck from <em>Fortes Brothers</em>. Though I was given an initial
wait time of 50 minutes, the truck only arrived 1.5 hours later!</p>
<p>It was a wheel lift tow truck. The guy drove the car over some pads
and then lifted the front wheels up using the truck lift. I sat in the
truck and rode to America’s Tire.</p>
<p>The tow truck guy put down the car in the America’s Tire parking lot
and left. The tire person assessed the car and said that a new tire
might be needed. They didn’t have the tire, but could get it next day.
So I left the car there overnight.</p>
<h3 id="day-2">Day 2</h3>
<p>Next day noon I got a text that the tire was replaced. When I went
there though, the tire guy informed me that the dashboard was fully lit
up with all possible error codes. I could see in my Toyota phone app
that there were 10 errors, all of them serious. The tire guy scared me
that maybe the car was not put in the right mode when it was towed
leading to failure of the transmission system and cooking the car! I was
shocked and called Toyota Roadside to ask for advice. They recommended
getting the car towed to my dealership for an assessment. I booked a tow
with Toyota Roadside Assistance, and just to be sure asked for a flatbed
tow truck to keep all 4 wheels off the road. The tow truck did not
arrive even after 3 hours and I eventually canceled it since the tire
shop was closing.</p>
<h3 id="day-3">Day 3</h3>
<p>I called Toyota Roadside Assistance again and booked a flatbed tow
truck. Just to confirm, I called the Fortes Brothers directly and they
informed me (differently) that flatbeds are super hard to get and their
truck would have a dolly or skates to put under all 4 wheels and that
would be enough. By this time all the errors had disappeared on my car
and just the <em>check engine</em> warning was on. The car was towed to
the Toyota dealership and after I explained the situation, they decided
to first do a diagnostic check. I also requested for a
<em>reimbursement</em> of the fees since the problem was created by a
tow truck provided by Toyota Roadside themselves. I was informed after a
few hours that the car was ready for pickup. They were able to find all
the error codes in the logs, but after resetting the system and driving
it around no errors showed up.</p>
<h3 id="root-cause">Root cause</h3>
<p>So what caused the errors? After reading <a
href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PriusPrime/comments/1djnz9t/fyi_on_being_towed/">this
post</a> and thinking about the situation, I think the culprit is the
<em>automatic parking brake</em>. I have it enabled it on my car and my
guess is that the first tow truck guy could not figure out how to
disable this when towing. And the sensors must have freaked out that the
rear wheels were rotating when in parking mode.</p>
