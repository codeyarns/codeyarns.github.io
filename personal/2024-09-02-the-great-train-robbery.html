<p>Looking to read some of the early non-science works of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Crichton"><strong>Michael
Crichton</strong></a> I picked up <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Train_Robbery_(novel)"><strong>The
Great Train Robbery</strong></a>. The sensational and fictional plot of
this novel is loosely based on the very real <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Gold_Robbery">Great Gold
Robbery of 1855</a> that happened on a train in Victorian England.</p>
<p>The mastermind of this story is an extremely clever gentleman named
<em>Edward Pierce</em>. He decides to loot the gold that is shipped
regularly by train to aid the Crimean War. Aiding him in this adventure
is his lockpick <em>Robert Agar</em> and his mistress <em>Madam
Miriam</em>. By using all manners of tricks he learns that the gold is
transported in 2 safes which have 4 keys distributed among a railway
office, a bank president and a bank employee. Most of the plot details
the elaborate ploys he devises to get wax copies of these keys. Even
after they get the keys, there are some plot-stopping changes to the way
the gold is transported. But in true third-act climactic fashion, Pierce
pulls a fantastic last-minute setup to still loot the gold and
escape.</p>
<p>One of the best aspects of a Crichton novel is that you come away
learning about something. The subject of this book is actually Victorian
England and the magical effect that trains had in this era. The reader
is sure to walk away from the book with a very real picture of life of
people in that era in England. The plot itself is nail biting, the
principal characters are memorable and the book is a very fast read.</p>
<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 4/4</p>
<p><strong>ISBN</strong>: 9780804171281</p>
