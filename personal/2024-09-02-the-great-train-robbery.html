<p>Looking to read some of the early non-science works of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Crichton"><strong>Michael Crichton</strong></a> I picked up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Train_Robbery_(novel)"><strong>The Great Train Robbery</strong></a>. The sensational and fictional plot of this novel is loosely based on the very real <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Gold_Robbery">Great Gold Robbery of 1855</a> that happened on a train in Victorian England.</p>
<p>The mastermind of this story is an extremely clever gentleman named <em>Edward Pierce</em>. He decides to loot the gold that is shipped regularly by train to aid the Crimean War. Aiding him in this adventure is his lockpick <em>Robert Agar</em> and his mistress <em>Madam Miriam</em>. By using all manners of tricks he learns that the gold is transported in 2 safes which have 4 keys distributed among a railway office, a bank president and a bank employee. Most of the plot details the elaborate ploys he devises to get wax copies of these keys. Even after they get the keys, there are some plot-stopping changes to the way the gold is transported. But in true third-act climactic fashion, Pierce pulls a fantastic last-minute setup to still loot the gold and escape.</p>
<p>One of the best aspects of a Crichton novel is that you come away learning about something. The subject of this book is actually Victorian England and the magical effect that trains had in this era. The reader is sure to walk away from the book with a very real picture of life of people in that era in England. The plot itself is nail biting, the principal characters are memorable and the book is a very fast read.</p>
<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 4/4</p>
<p><strong>ISBN</strong>: 9780804171281</p>
