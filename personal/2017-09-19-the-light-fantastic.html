href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Light_Fantastic"><strong>The
Light Fantastic</strong></a> is the second book in the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discworld"><strong>Discworld</strong></a>
series by <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Pratchett"><strong>Terry
Pratchett</strong></a>. At the end of the super-entertaining <a
href="2016-12-31-the-color-of-magic.html"><strong>The Color of
Magic</strong></a>, our anti-heroes <strong>Rincewind</strong>, the
wizard who cannot cast a spell to save himself, and
<strong>Twoflower</strong>, the naive tourist, were falling off the edge
of the Disc. In true movie-sequel fashion, they are saved at the
beginning of this novel and put out on another romp through the Disc
here. Harmful spells have been set free that have set the Disc on a
collision course with a star. And the only person who can save the world
is Rincewind, quite obviously. There are more adventures, more damsels,
more knights and more laughter. Pratchett is really good at presenting
the technologies and ironies of our world and embedding them in the
fantasy world of the Disc. But since this book is essentially the same
as the first one, it is not <em>that</em> much fun. Still, this book is
guaranteed to deliver some snortling hours of fun.
<strong>Rating:</strong> 3/4</p>

<p><strong>Excerpts:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Twoflower was a tourist, the first of the species to evolve on the
Disc, and fundamental to his very existence was the rock-hard belief
that nothing bad could really happen to him because he was not involved;
he also believed that anyone could understand anything he said provided
he spoke loudly and slowly, that people were basically trustworthy, and
that anything could be sorted out among men of goodwill if they just
acted sensibly.</p>
<p>It has already been hinted that around this time there was some
disagreement among the fraternity of wizards about how to practise
magic. Younger wizards in particular went about saying that it was time
that magic started to update its image and that they should all stop
mucking about with bits of wax and bone and put the whole thing on a
properly-organised basis, with research programmes and three-day
conventions in good hotels where they could read papers with titles like
“Whither Geomancy?” and “The role of Seven-League Boots in a caring
society.” Trymon, for example, hardly ever did any magic these days but
ran the Order with hourglass efficiency and wrote lots of memos and had
a big chart on his office wall, covered with coloured blobs and flags
and lines that no-one else really understood but which looked very
impressive.</p>
<p>Then the chieftain turned respectfully to his guest, a small figure
carefully warming his chilblains by the fire, and said: “But our guest,
whose name is legend, must tell us truly: what is it that a man may call
the greatest things in life?” The guest paused in the middle of another
unsuccessful attempt to light up. “What shay?” he said, toothlessly. “I
said: what is it that a man may call the greatest things in life?” The
warriors leaned closer. This should be worth hearing. The guest thought
long and hard and then said, with deliberation: “Hot water, good
dentishtry and shoft lavatory paper.”</p>
<p>“He’s mad?” “Sort of mad. But mad with lots of money.” “Ah, then he
can’t be mad. I’ve been around; if a man has lots of money he’s just
eccentric.”</p>
“I know you don’t. Rincewind, all the shops have been smashed open,
there was a whole bunch of people across the street helping themselves
to musical instruments, can you believe that?” “Yeah,” said Rincewind,
picking up a knife and testing its blade thoughtfully. “Luters, I
expect.”
