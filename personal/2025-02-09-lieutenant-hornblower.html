<p><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant_Hornblower"><strong>Lieutenant
Hornblower</strong></a> is the second book in the <em>Hornblower
series</em> by <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._S._Forester"><strong>C. S.
Forester</strong></a>. At the end of <a
href="2024-12-29-mr-midshipman-hornblower.html"><strong>Mr.¬†Midshipman
Hornblower</strong></a> he was promoted to junior Lieutenant and that‚Äôs
where we find him here on the <em>HMS Renown</em>. He, a new senior
lieutenant <em>Bush</em> and the first lieutenant <em>Buckland</em> are
positively terrified by their insane captain <em>Sawyer</em>. A mutiny
is almost in the plans when the captain falls down stairs and is
paralyzed and taken insane. Buckland takes control of the ship and with
the help of Bush and some ingenious thinking by Hornblower is able to
plan, fight and defeat a Spanish coastal fort in the West Indies and
take their ships. The captured Spanish erupt on the Renown, but are put
down thanks to timely courageous action by Hornblower. Returning back to
safe harbor, they are all tried in court and Hornblower is promoted to
<em>Commander</em> of a smaller ship. But just before Hornblower can
celebrate, the war with Napoleon ends in truce and all of them lose
their jobs. Our protagonist ends up playing card games with naval
officers at a club to make ends meet. Will Lady Luck shine on him again
and lift him to his naval destiny?</p>
<p>Unlike the first book, which had multiple stories, this book has a
single story and I liked that. The narration is from the point of view
of Bush, so we get an unique perspective of how Hornblower is viewed by
another lieutenant who, though initially wary of his pluck, learns to
respect his vitality. The detailed military strategy hatched to capture
the Spanish fort and tricks used to convince them to surrender are truly
enjoyable to experience. A lot of the writing is also about the
hierarchy of power on a ship, the ranks and duties of the officers and
their difficulty in getting promoted. We are witness to how good fortune
and bad luck can make or break an officer‚Äôs life career. And here is
something surprising: I think this work stands out as a great book on
engineering management, not kidding. There was quite literally nothing I
did not like in this second nail-biting naval adventure and I am eager
for the next one.</p>
<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 5/5</p>

<h2 id="excerpts">Excerpts</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>He was aware that naval officers could be divided into active
individuals and passive individuals, into those eager for responsibility
and action and into those content to wait until action was forced on
them. Before that he had learned the simpler lesson that officers could
be divided into the efficient and the blunderers, and also into the
intelligent and the stupid ‚Äî this last division was nearly the same as
the one immediately preceding, but not quite. There were the officers
who could be counted on to act quickly and correctly in an emergency,
and those who could not ‚Äî again the dividing line did not quite coincide
with the preceding.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And in any case logical thinking on the subject of reputation and
promotion was not easy, because during all these years Bush had become
more and more imbued with the knowledge that the service was a hard and
ungrateful one, in which fortune was even more capricious than in other
walks of life. Good luck came and went in the navy as unpredictably as
death chose its victims when a broadside swept a crowded deck.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Bush had learned something during the past few weeks which his
service during the years had not called to his attention. In the ships
of the line in which he had served there had only been minutes of battle
for every week at sea, and he had gradually become fixed in the idea
that seamanship was the one requisite for a naval officer. To be master
of the countless details of managing a wooden sailing ship; not only to
be able to handle her under sail, but to be conversant with all the
petty but important trifles regarding cordage and cables, pumps and salt
pork, dry rot and the Articles of War; that was what was necessary. But
he knew now of other qualities equally necessary: a bold and yet
thoughtful initiative, moral as well as physical courage, tactful
handling both of superiors and of subordinates, ingenuity and quickness
of thought. A fighting navy needed to fight, and needed fighting men to
lead it.</p>
