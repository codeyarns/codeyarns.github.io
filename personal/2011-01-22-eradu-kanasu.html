<p>You might say I grew up to the music of movies like <a href="http://kn.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E0%B2%8E%E0%B2%B0%E0%B2%A1%E0%B3%81_%E0%B2%95%E0%B2%A8%E0%B2%B8%E0%B3%81"><strong>Eradu Kanasu</strong></a> (<a href="http://kn.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E0%B2%8E%E0%B2%B0%E0%B2%A1%E0%B3%81_%E0%B2%95%E0%B2%A8%E0%B2%B8%E0%B3%81">ಎರಡು ಕನಸು</a>). Songs of this romantic drama were a perennial favorite at home during childhood. Parents, uncles and aunts regaled me with stories of how they had sneaked away to catch it on its release, it having caused quite some flutter during their college years. I also remember finding a printed songbook of the movie one summer and learning the lyrics. Quite ironic that I only recently got around to watching this 1974 flick starring a young Rajkumar, Kalpana and Manjula.</p>
<p>Ramu (Rajkumar) is an English literature professor madly in love with his cousin Lalitha (Manjula). Their plans are thwarted due to a family squabble and Ramu marries Gowri (Kalpana) fearing his mother’s failing health. Gowri is a freewheeling romantic creature whose rosy dreams of marriage are crushed when Ramu shows no interest in her, mourning in the lost love of Lalitha. The conundrum is resolved in the climax with Ramu realizing the love of Gowri.</p>
<p>Eradu Kanasu in Kannada means <em>Two Dreams</em> and it refers to the love of two women in the life of the protagonist. The movie is based on a novel by Vani. Manjula has little scope in the story, while Rajkumar and Kalpana totally own their roles. I liked the irony of how Ramu, much like his namesake, puts the woman who loves him through undue misery. The story progression in this movie is extremely fast, before you know it the climax surprises you and it is all over! 😊</p>
<p>This is one of those few movies where every single song rocks, both in music and literature. <strong>Endendu Ninnanu</strong> and <strong>Tham Nam</strong> are passionate romantic numbers, while the evocative <strong>Badi Hoda</strong> is the plea of a man devoid of all hope. <strong>Poojisalende</strong> and <strong>Indu Enage Govinda</strong> are prayers for direction, the music in both being truly divine. I find Poojisalende very pleasing to listen to during evenings. I love the nuanced lyrics of Govinda, and was surprised to discover that it was written by Raghavendra Swamy! Eradu Kanasu is a thoroughly entertaining Kannada drama that is sure to remain evergreen.</p>
