<p>When in middle school, I spent an entire summer in Mysore staying at my uncle’s place devouring chakkali, Tintin-Asterix comics and Chandamama-Balamitra magazines. One of the images stuck in my mind from that idyllic vacation is a Dirty Dancing T-shirt that my uncle frequently wore. I only found out that this was the name of a movie a lifetime later when the Internet entered my life. A memory is a fickle creature and on a whim I decided to watch <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirty_Dancing"><strong>Dirty Dancing</strong></a> to satiate this childhood curiosity.</p>
<p>Dirty Dancing turns out to be a dance-romance which is (sadly?) much like a Bollywood rich-girl-loves-poor-guy movie. The rich girl is Frances (Jennifer Grey), who along with her white-collar parents and sister are vacationing at a lake resort. Johnny (Patrick Swayze) is an instructor at the resort who teaches ballroom dancing to the visitors. He and his blue-collar brethren live in separate quarters (“visitors are not allowed”) where they sweat and groove to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mambo_%28dance%29"><strong>mambo</strong></a> (hence the title Dirty Dancing 😉). Even an Indian infant can guess the plot from here: Frances is smitten by Johnny, her father objects, throw in a white-over-blue-collar atrocity, a final climactic dance when everything is settled and the errant dad sees the light.</p>
<p>Jennifer Grey is pretty and Patrick Swayze is stone-faced, but they have good chemistry and manage with their good dancing skills. The dances and dance-training scenes are well choreographed and great to watch. The final track <strong>(I’ve Had) The Time of My Life</strong> is quite memorable. Dirty Dancing is yet another movie that is over-hyped (remember <a href="2011-11-27-saturday-night-fever.html"><strong>Saturday Night Fever</strong></a>?) and can be strictly watched once.</p>
