<p><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rising_Sun_(Crichton_novel)"><strong>Rising
Sun</strong></a> easily stood out from the rest of the books by <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Crichton"><strong>Michael
Crichton</strong></a> that I have read so far. The story is narrated by
<em>Peter Smith</em>, a LAPD liason for Japanese, who is called in when
an escort’s murder is discovered at the grand opening of a new Japanese
corporation skyscraper in LA. Smith is a greenhorn, so is asked to pull
in a Japanese expert <em>John Connor</em> to the case. 1992 is from an
era when Japanese mega corporations dominated the US. And so is the
fictional Nakamoto Corporation of this story, whose executive
<em>Ishiguri</em> tries all sorts of levers to delay, deceive and defuse
the attention from this murder. The surveillance tapes are found after
much delay and found to be copied or fabricated in some way. The murder
also seems to be connected to the takeover of a US semiconductor company
<em>MicroCon</em> by Nakamoto. As the Japanese tighten the noose around
Smith and Connor, the duo try to figure out the true murderer within 2
days.</p>
<p>The reason this books stands out for Crichton is that I have never
seen him this preachy before! Every single page of this book has Connor
educating the naive Smith about the social and corporate culture of the
Japanese and scaring him about Japan’s huge investments in the US, their
takeover of the world’s manufacturing industry, and their lobbying power
among US politicians. Reading this book in 2024, the current fear of
China taking over the US, is strikingly eerie. I guess Japan must have
seemed like it was about to overtake the US in 1992 for Crichton to have
written a novel just to bring light to this. The murder mystery is
actually good, with enough intrigue and use of realistic technology for
investigation. If Crichton had not overloaded the book with fear of the
Japanese and Connon-Smith duo had been more well balanced, this would
have been an even better read.</p>
<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 4/5</p>
