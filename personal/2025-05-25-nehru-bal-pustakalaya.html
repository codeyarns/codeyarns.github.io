<p>Flipping through the news from India I noticed that a prominent
astrophysicist <em>Jayant Narlikar</em> had passed away recently. That
name seemed vaguely familiar from my childhood and with a little digging
I re-discovered that he was the author of one of my favorite childhood
books <em>A Journey through the Universe</em>. This was one of the many
fantastic children’s books from the <em>Nehru Bal Pustakalaya</em>
collection that were a large part of my early years.</p>
<p>I first discovered these books when my school had a book fair
organized by their publisher <em>National Book Trust</em>. It was a
thrilling and unique experience to see a part of your school transform
into a book fair for a few days, to get some cash from parents, to
sample and shop the books alone or with friends (without parent
supervision) and to make the crucial decision on which few books to buy
with the limited amount of cash. The few books I bought in this way felt
so precious, the feel of that rough paper, the smell of freshness, that
iconic rose logo at the top-left corner of each book cover and the
beautiful illustrations by Sudhir Dar. I would read these books a
thousand times over and they truly showed me what a wonderful world I
inhabited.</p>
<p>These books stood out in that era with their style, with each book
having its own unique cover and inner art. Also, rare for that era,
these were full color covers, not limited 2 or 3 bland shades, but
shockingly bright colors in their full glory. Jayant Karlikar’s book and
the 2-part <em>Inventions that changed the world</em> by Najabat Ali
remain the most memorable of the lot to me with superb funny cartoons by
Sudhir Dar. These books covered pretty much the every swath of science,
from physics to scientists, giving me a taste of things that lay beyond
the little world in India of the 80s.</p>
