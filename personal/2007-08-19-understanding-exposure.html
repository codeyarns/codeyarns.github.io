href="http://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Exposure-Photographs-Digital-Updated/dp/0817463003/">Understanding
Exposure</a> by Brian Peterson (5/5) – This is a book aimed mainly at
the beginner-intermediate photographer. I picked it up after a user <a
href="http://digital-photography-school.com/blog/understanding-exposure-by-brian-peterson-a-reader-review/">reviewed</a>
it at Digital Photography School. I simply loved the book and learnt a
ton from it. Why? The book is focussed on explaining the 3 elements of
the <em>photographic triangle</em>: aperture, shutter speed and light
(ISO) and how they’re related. This was perfect for me because I’m now
at a stage where I can kind of compose photos, but have <em>no idea</em>
what combination of aperture/shutter-speed will give the most
<em>creative</em> exposure.</p>
<p>The book is just 160 pages and is composed of short chapters (each of
just a couple of paragraphs) each dealing with specific details about
the above. Every page is full of Peterson’s photos which illustrate what
he’s trying to explain in that page. Also interesting is how Peterson
gives the settings for that photo and even the backstory of how he did
it. I loved everything – the writing style of Peterson, his examples and
explanations. I highly recommend this book. I know I’ll be rereading
this book soon.</p>
