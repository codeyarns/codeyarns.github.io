<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 3/4 (Easy comedy that can be enjoyed with
anyone and anytime.)</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Family"><strong>Modern
Family</strong></a> is a comedy TV series that first aired in 2009. It
is shot to look like a documentary of 3 families, who are actually
related to each other. Family-1 is a traditional mom-pop nuclear family
with 3 kids. Only here, the housewife is the bulwark of the family,
while the husband is lazy, overconfident and a bit stupid. Family-2 is
an old man who has remarried a younger Columbian woman and is looking
after the son from her first marriage. Family-3 is a gay couple who have
adopted a Vietnamese baby daughter and are trying to bring her up. The
interactions and problems of these 3 families provides the fodder for
the humour in Modern Family.</p>
<p><strong>Modern Family</strong> is an excellent comedy, which can
easily be enjoyed by anyone and anytime. It is really easy to take a
liking to and identify with a few of the characters. My favorites are
Family-1, especially the stupid dad. Season 1 of Modern Family
definitely delivers the goods, it will be nice to see if it keep it
going in later season.</p>
