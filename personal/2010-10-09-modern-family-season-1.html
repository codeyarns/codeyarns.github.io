<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 3/4 (Easy comedy that can be enjoyed with anyone and anytime.)</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Family"><strong>Modern Family</strong></a> is a comedy TV series that first aired in 2009. It is shot to look like a documentary of 3 families, who are actually related to each other. Family-1 is a traditional mom-pop nuclear family with 3 kids. Only here, the housewife is the bulwark of the family, while the husband is lazy, overconfident and a bit stupid. Family-2 is an old man who has remarried a younger Columbian woman and is looking after the son from her first marriage. Family-3 is a gay couple who have adopted a Vietnamese baby daughter and are trying to bring her up. The interactions and problems of these 3 families provides the fodder for the humour in Modern Family.</p>
<p><strong>Modern Family</strong> is an excellent comedy, which can easily be enjoyed by anyone and anytime. It is really easy to take a liking to and identify with a few of the characters. My favorites are Family-1, especially the stupid dad. Season 1 of Modern Family definitely delivers the goods, it will be nice to see if it keep it going in later season.</p>
