<p>I was recently reminded by <strong>Folio Society</strong>, who publish beautiful editions of classic books, that it had been 69 years since James Bond‚Äôs <a href="https://www.foliosociety.com/usa/casino-royale.html">first novel</a> was published back in 1953. Having watched pretty much every single Bond movie, I have vague memories of reading a few of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Fleming">Ian Fleming‚Äôs</a> works in my teens. I decided to start the journey again with the first book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casino_Royale_(novel)"><strong>Casino Royale</strong></a>.</p>
<p>The story is set in the Cold War days between the Western powers and USSR after WW2. Our sauve secret agent is on mission at a famous casino in the seaside town of <strong>Royale-les-Eaux</strong> in France. He is good at cards and his mission is to defeat and ruin the villain <strong>Le Chiffre</strong> is the front through whom USSR is funding Communist activities in France. Le Chiffre has made some bad investments with the Red money and their secretive <strong>SMERSH</strong> operatives will get him unless he wins back his losses at the multi-million high-stakes baccarat game. Aiding our hero are Felix Leiter (CIA), Mathis (UK) and a beautiful Vesper Lynd as his love interest.</p>
<p>Fleming beautifully sets up the lead to the baccarat game, even giving us an excellent introduction to how it is played. Bond twice escapes attempts at his life to confront and defeat Le Chiffre in a truly nail biting competition. It is to the testament of the author‚Äôs writing that he still had me at the edge of my seat, even after seeing so many scenes of Bond playing cards in movies. Neither Le Chiffre nor SMERSH take these actions lightly and these lead to some painful consequences for Bond and Lynd. Having gotten out of these predicaments, Bond is badly injured and recovers in a romantic seaside getaway with Lynd where he falls madly in love and decides to propose. However, love is not meant for our hero as a final reveal seals the tragic climax and leaves us begging for more Bond adventures.</p>
<p>The book is short, fast and hard to put down. It is a testament to Fleming‚Äôs quality of writing that it was this nail biting despite having seen so many Bond movies. The Bond here is closer to the brutist Daniel Craig, than to the smooth Sean Connery of the earlier movies. Though it is the first story, Bond faces some extreme physical torture and huge emotional setbacks. We typically do not seen such tragic consequences for Bond in the movies, save a couple of them. The introduction to the secret services of the Cold War era, the baccarat game, everything is thrilling. This is a recommended read and I am truly looking forward to the rest of the books in the series.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/4</p>
