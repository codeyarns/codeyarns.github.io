<p>The sad, hard and futile life of the rural poor in British Raj India
pervades <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nectar_in_a_Sieve"><strong>Nectar in
a Sieve</strong></a> by <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Markandaya"><strong>Kamala
Markandaya</strong></a>. It begins with the marriage of the narrator
Rukmani to a landless farmer named Nathan at age 12 and ends with his
death by her side. What fills the in-between is a few years of happiness
with good harvests and young children and many years of deprivation,
starvation, disease and death due to drought and floods. Urbanization
also rears its ugly head in their tiny village in the form of a smelly
tannery and a British doctor named Kenny. Rukmani hates the sight of the
polluting and crowded lifestyle brought about by these changes, but
poverty drives her children to work at that very tannery and later sail
off as labourers to British plantations in Ceylon. The middle-aged
couple is hit hard when their landlord sells off his land to the tannery
and they have to eke out a hard life in the nearest city.</p>
<p>Published in 1954, this novel is supposedly the first novel about
India to get popular in USA and in its textbooks. I was pleasantly
surprised to learn that Markandaya was born in Mysore, studied in Madras
and later settled in the UK. Though no places are named, the characters
and settings are quite obviously of the Mysore-Madras region. The story
is quite similar to <a href="2016-10-02-the-good-earth.html"><strong>The
Good Earth</strong></a>, which I recently read, and the writing is
similarly achingly beautiful, though the focus here remains on Rukmani
and her family and not so much about the happenings in her country. The
India here is somewhat unimaginable now in some its dimensions: an age
before electricity, literacy and modern medicine. Caste is somehow
absent, which is surprising. The onus is the plight of the rural (and
later urban) poor and their hapless existence as mere pawns in a grand
game played by nature, fate and the rich. The landless, illiterate,
uneducated characters swallow whatever comes their way without a protest
because neither do they have the means nor the social structure to do
anything about it. This slim novel is laden with incredible prose and
filled with many unforgettable characters like the Old Granny.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/4</p>

<p><strong>Excerpts:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>While the sun shines on you and the fields are green and beautiful to
the eye, and your husband sees beauty in you which no one has seen
before, and you have a good store of grain laid away for hard times, a
roof over you and a sweet stirring in your body, what more can a woman
ask for? My heart sang and my feet were light as I went about my work,
getting up at sunrise and going to sleep content. Peace and quiet were
ours. How well I recall it, how grateful I am that not all the clamour
which invaded our lives later could subdue the memory or still the
longing for it. Rather, it has strengthened it: had there not been what
has been, I might never have known how blessed we were.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Nathan prepares the bier, I see him lifting the body on to it. Then
he goes out, walking towards the town. At dawn the funeral drums begin,
and soon after our friends and neighbours come. Granny first, though
hardly able to walk; then Durgan; Kannan with his wife, bearing a few
jasmine buds; and Kali, bringing with her a muslin cloth to cover the
bier. They pay their respects in silence, and when the sun has risen,
the men pick up the bier and depart; but the women stay behind, for this
is the custom. All that morning the sound of the drums comes faintly to
us, rising and falling, rising and falling with the wind; until at last
a final beat comes quivering through the air and we strain our ears for
the next, but this, this sound which has already gone, is the last. Now
not even a heap of bones: only a few ashes to show that once a man has
lived.</p>
</blockquote>
