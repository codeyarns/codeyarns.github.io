<p>We think of our planet as being shaped by Sun, weather, water,
earthquakes, volcanoes and geological processes. In <a
href="https://www.ferrisjabr.com/book"><strong>Becoming
Earth</strong></a>, the science writer <a
href="https://www.ferrisjabr.com/"><strong>Ferris Jabr</strong></a>
tries to show evidence that in addition to the above, our planet has
always been shaped by microbes, plant and animal life too. Divided into
3 parts on rock, water and air, each part looks at the author’s journeys
to various parts of Earth to meet scientists who have discovered
fascinating ways in which life shaped and continues to affect Earth.</p>
<p>In the first part on <em>Rock</em>, we travel to deep caves and mines
to discover how microbes deep inside the Earth’s crust have been chewing
through rocks to break them down into soil for millions of years. We
travel to the frozen Russian steppe to learn how the stomping around by
now-extinct mammoths there might have helped grass emerge from the
megafauna of that period. Finally, we visit the author’s own backyard in
Oregon where he and his partner were able to coax a diversity of plants
to grow out of rock-hard ground thanks to the power of the roots of
specific plants.</p>
<p>In the second part on <em>Water</em>, we discover the massive scale
of plankton in the seas and how they affect marine life and the carbon
in the atmosphere. Off the coast of California, we learn about the
effect of scale of seaweed and kelp forests in the oceans and how they
help in sequestering massive amounts of carbon. Finally, we travel to
Kamilo Beach in Hawaii where the planet’s plastic trash has been washing
up and creating new substrates by fusing with rock.</p>
<p>In the final part on <em>Air</em>, we travel to Brazil to climb the
Amazon Tall Tower Observatory to learn how the tall trees of the Amazon
and microbes that produce proteins seed ice crystals in clouds and cause
rain. In California, we learn how Native Americans uses controlled burns
as a land management tool to shape their forests and allow a diversity
of fauna to flourish.</p>
<p>This was a delicious well-researched book to read, with the author
being adept at weaving together travels to exotic places,scientists,
historical events and discoveries together. There are a good set of
color photos in the book to aid the narration. There is no doubt that
microbes, plants, animals and especially humans have changed the
atmosphere and the planet. While it is evident that microbes, plankton
and human industrialization can have massive effects, many of the other
cases presented by the author (such as megafauna, plastic on a beach)
are weaker and sometimes unrelated to the agenda of the book. And as
always, I am skeptical of science writers and prefer such books to be
written by actual scientists, who are usually far more skeptical and far
less flowery in the praise of evidence. Regardless, this book easily
takes the reader on a fascinating journey in time and space around the
world showing us the wonders of our planet.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 3/5</p>
