<p>Saw the movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0137523/">Fight Club</a>. Starring Edward Norton and Brad Pitt, it's based on the novel by Chuck Palahniuk. Edward Norton plays the narrator (whose name is never revealed) who has insomnia. He discovers that attending support groups helps him sleep, so he starts doing that regularly. He comes across Marla, who is also <em>faking</em> like him to visit support groups. After he finds her, the support groups no longer help and his insomnia comes back. On a flight he runs into Tyler (Brad Pitt), an eccentric character who manufactures soap. After his flat catches fire, he meets up with Tyler and moves into his rundown house. He and Tyler start having fun by beating each other up. When other people also show an interest to join in this activity, he and Tyler formalize the underground organization by calling it <em>Fight Club</em> and giving it rules. Soon, it grows very popular and Tyler starts giving out assignments to its members under the name <em>Project Mayhem</em>. These increasingly result in hurting people and destroying property. The narrator begins to withdraw from Taylor's violent activities but can't. When he finds out that Project Mayhem involves a plan to cause massive destruction, he tries to find out the plan from Tyler and stop it. Who is Tyler whom the narrator can't seem to escape from? Can he stop the plan?</p>
<p>If you've seen the movie, you know the surprise element. Actually, there are loads of clues all along indicating who Tyler really is. So, yeah, the story is interesting. Pitt and Norton have delivered neat performances. The cinematography matches up well with the gritty feel of the movie. The music score by the <em>Dust Brothers</em> is catchy. The only thing I found disconcerting is the violence. It gets quite excessive and is a major turn-off. Except for that, this is a neat movie.</p>
