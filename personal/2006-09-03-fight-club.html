<p>Saw the movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0137523/">Fight
Club</a>. Starring Edward Norton and Brad Pitt, it’s based on the novel
by Chuck Palahniuk. Edward Norton plays the narrator (whose name is
never revealed) who has insomnia. He discovers that attending support
groups helps him sleep, so he starts doing that regularly. He comes
across Marla, who is also <em>faking</em> like him to visit support
groups. After he finds her, the support groups no longer help and his
insomnia comes back. On a flight he runs into Tyler (Brad Pitt), an
eccentric character who manufactures soap. After his flat catches fire,
he meets up with Tyler and moves into his rundown house. He and Tyler
start having fun by beating each other up. When other people also show
an interest to join in this activity, he and Tyler formalize the
underground organization by calling it <em>Fight Club</em> and giving it
rules. Soon, it grows very popular and Tyler starts giving out
assignments to its members under the name <em>Project Mayhem</em>. These
increasingly result in hurting people and destroying property. The
narrator begins to withdraw from Taylor’s violent activities but can’t.
When he finds out that Project Mayhem involves a plan to cause massive
destruction, he tries to find out the plan from Tyler and stop it. Who
is Tyler whom the narrator can’t seem to escape from? Can he stop the
plan?</p>
<p>If you’ve seen the movie, you know the surprise element. Actually,
there are loads of clues all along indicating who Tyler really is. So,
yeah, the story is interesting. Pitt and Norton have delivered neat
performances. The cinematography matches up well with the gritty feel of
the movie. The music score by the <em>Dust Brothers</em> is catchy. The
only thing I found disconcerting is the violence. It gets quite
excessive and is a major turn-off. Except for that, this is a neat
movie.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/5</p>
