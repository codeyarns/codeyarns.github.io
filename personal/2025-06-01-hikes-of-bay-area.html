Sierra Azul Preserve</a></h2>
<p>Mount Umunhum is one of the tallest peaks in the Bay Area. We parked
at the <em>Mount Umunhum Summit Parking Area</em>, where a flight of
stairs takes you to the summit. At the summit there are viewpoints with
great views of the South Bay. In my opinion, this summit has the most
stunning views of the South Bay, you can see all the cities spread out
below you in a valley and the mountains ranged all around and the
back.</p>
<p>There is a cool abandoned cubical building on top which was a defense
radar system. The facilities look brand new (in 2026) and are very well
maintained.</p>
<p>We took the <em>Mount Umunhum Trail</em> down from the summit for
about 2.5 miles and then back the same distance. The trail was mostly
shaded by trees and we passed streams and bridges. It was a relaxing
green hike when we did this on a surprisingly sunny day in wintry
January.</p>

<p>We parked in the lot near the <em>Lexington Reservoir County
Park</em> near the Alma Gate Entrance. Looking at the weather and energy
level of our kids on the spring day, we completed a 2.4 mile loop
hike:</p>
<ul>
<li>Started up north on Jones Trail (0.5 miles)</li>
<li>East to Novitiate Trail (0.2 miles)</li>
<li>South to Manzanita Trail (0.4 miles)</li>
<li>East to Serpentine Trail (0.2 miles)</li>
<li>North to Range Trail (0.2 miles)</li>
<li>West to Navitiate Trail (0.4 miles)</li>
<li>South to Jones Trail (0.5 miles)</li>
</ul>
