<h2 id="movies">Movies</h2>
<h3 id="species"><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species_(film)">Species</a></h3>
<p>This is one of those movies that was famous in my teenage years for
obvious reasons and it was interesting to see it again as an adult. SETI
scientists receive a reply from space with DNA information and
scientists use that to create a human/alien hybrid named <em>Sil</em>
(Natasha Henstridge). She breaks free, going around LA mating with guys
in order to reproduce and spawn, while she is hunted by a team of Ben
Kingsley and some decent actors. The movie hits a niche of multiple
genres (sci-fi/erotic/horror), there are some great surprising moments
and is still intriguing to watch today.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/5</p>
<h3 id="species-ii"><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species_II">Species II</a></h3>
<p>The sequel to Species starts off well - astronauts on the first
mission to Mars get infected by the same alien pathogens as the first
movie. The lead astronaut (a male this time), goes around mating with
women, while the scientists (who seem to have learnt no lesson from the
first movie) have created a second Sil (played by Natasha Henstridge
again). This movie gets more and more bizarre as it goes along, with the
astronaut reproducing 20-something boys who he keeps in some desolate
ranch house so they can get into the cocoon stage. The plot is god-awful
absurd, the dialogue is terrible and there is nothing redeemable in this
movie.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 2/5</p>
<h3 id="the-fugitive"><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fugitive_(1993_film)">The
Fugitive</a></h3>
<p>Harrison Ford is an acclaimed Chicago surgeon who runs into an
one-armed attacker at home and finds his wife dead. He escapes from his
death sentence when the prison bus has an accident. He is now a fugitive
on the run from Tommy Lee Jones, all the while trying to find the
one-armed killer with a prosthetic arm and his motive for killing his
wife. This movie is thrilling from start to finish, never resting for a
minute, all the while keeping the viewer guessing.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 5/5</p>
<h3 id="mary-poppins"><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Poppins_(film)">Mary
Poppins</a></h3>
<p>Our family was delighted and entertained by this 1964 children’s
classic by Disney. The story and characters are based on the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Poppins_(book_series)">children’s
books</a> by <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._L._Travers"><strong>P. L.
Travers</strong></a>. However, the fantastic songs and music are totally
original and created for the movie by the Sherman Brothers. Julie
Andrews as Mary Poppins, Dick Van Dyke as Bert and the delightful
children Jane and Michael are all wonderfully cast. The story is set in
1910 London and taken in that context, the movie has not aged at all. A
parent discovering how he is neglecting playing with his children is a
timeless message.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 5/5</p>
