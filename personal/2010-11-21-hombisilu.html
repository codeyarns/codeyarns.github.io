<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 3/4 (An evergreen romantic drama of a working couple by Geethapriya)</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hombisilu">Hombisilu</a></strong> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hombisilu">ಹೊಂಬಿಸಿಲು</a>) is a classic romantic drama in Kannada that I found is just as watchable and relevant as it probably was in its day. Directed by Geethapriya, it is based on a novel by Usha Navarathnaram. Dr. Natraj (Vishnuvardhan) runs a nursing home in a town near Mangalore. While looking out to recruit a lady doctor to assist him with maternity patients he falls in love with Dr. Roopa (Aarathi) and marries her. Their match is perfect, but marital discord arises immediately after due to petty issues and threatens to derail their relationship.</p>

<p>Hombisilu (ಹೊಂಬಿಸಿಲು) in Kannada is the word for <em>twilight</em>. It is a perfect romantic drama on the small problems that arise in any new relationship and their potential to create strife between couples if left unhandled. The plot especially focuses on the difficulty of a working woman with her husband and her work. The setting, plot and production of this movie by Geethapriya strongly reminded me of Hrishikesh Mukherjee. Much like his movies, here too the focus is solely on the minutiae of the everyday life of a working couple. For a movie released in 1978, this movie is surprisingly relevant for the hectic and mine-ridden worklives we live today. The songs in the movie are hummable and loving, two of which are my all-time favorites:** Jeeva Veene** (the tune is to die for!) and <strong>Neerabittu Nelada Mele</strong>. Vishnuvardhan and especially Aarathi have acted extremely well and are truly at their prime here. Aarathi is so expressive with her eyes and face, she does not need words to communicate in most of the emotive scenes. Hombisilu is a must watch, an evergreen romantic drama of a working couple by Geethapriya.</p>
