<p>With my laptop fan conked out (meaning no browsing on the weekend) I
rushed to the library before it closed up on Friday night and picked up
Michael Crichton’s <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Fear"><strong>State of
Fear</strong></a>. How pertinent that this book had been heavily
criticized as a tirade against global warming and Al Gore + IPCC won the
Nobel Peace (!) Prize recently. Crichton took heavy beating in the
reviews for this book. But, surprisingly by the time I finished this
book I didn’t have the same feeling.</p>
<p>Like all of Crichton’s works here too there is some
technology/science whose ill-effects form the basis of the story. In
Jurassic Park it was genetics and here it is environmental science or
more specifically global warming. The fictional story is about 2 groups:
a hard-core environmental group called NERF (think Green Peace) and
Kenner, a MIT professor who wants to debunk their nefarious plans. NERF
is headed by Drake and will go to any lengths to grab media attention
about global warming. To <em>raise</em> the profile of global warming
NERF undertakes <em>eco-terrorism</em>, it plans to set off some global
catastrophes right in time for a scheduled conference on climate change.
Caught between Drake and Kenner is Peter Evans, who the author uses as
an analogue of the general public. Evans joins Kenner and as they travel
around the globe to foil Drake’s plan, Kenner explains to Evans in long
conversations about how not everything about global warming is as simple
as it sounds nor known or understood.</p>
<p>Looking at the book as just a thriller, it is not upto the usual
Crichton mark. It has the taste of a Clive Cussler rather than Crichton.
But, the main soul of the book is its tirade against global warming. The
author is thorough here. Footnotes to journal papers, studies and
articles are peppered throughout the pages wherever any of the main
characters takes a side on global warming.</p>
<p>Some of the main arguments in the book are that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Global warming is being blown out of proportion by the nexus of
politicians, lawyers and media. The bedsharing of politics and science
should be extremely worrying for science.</p></li>
<li><p>The high profile environmental agencies are today full of lawyers
and are interested in nothing but raising money, sueing and grabbing
media attention.</p></li>
<li><p>Environment and climate researchers (and hence their work) are
being forced to take sides. There is enormous pressure and money being
forced on by the industry on one side and environmentalists on the other
to bias their works.</p></li>
<li><p>A lot more study into climate change and environment is needed.
There are still no reliable methods of predicting global climate for
even a decade let alone hundreds of years.</p></li>
<li><p>Earth has always been changing. It has underwent several cycles
of ice ages. The current climate changes look like part of the current
ongoing cycle.</p></li>
<li><p>Human CO2 contributions aren’t enough to cause the kind of
<em>catastrophic</em> climate changes that global warming predicts. At
least, not yet.</p></li>
<li><p>There are several scientific theories which are being snubbed
because they neither support nor oppose global warming (thus don’t look
good on the mass media). For example, the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_heat_island">urban heat island
effect</a> for temperature increases in cities.</p></li>
<li><p>Most environmental solutions being proposed haven’t been
subjected to a cost-to-benefit analysis. Not even if the cost is
enviromental cost.</p></li>
<li><p>Several environmental treaties are being signed where developing
and under developed countries are being subjected to regulations that
the developed countries themselves never followed or (in some cases)
will not follow.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In a detailed epilogue, Crichton describes one other scientific
phenomenon which every prominent person in the USA supported at one time
– <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenics">eugenics</a>.
(<em>“Society has no business to permit degenerates to reproduce their
kind.”</em> – Theodore Roosevelt.) During its heyday any scientist who
doubted its scientific veracity was shut up. Instead of allowing science
to study if eugenics worked at all, everyone jumped on the bandwagon
since they saw a clean way here to <em>eliminate</em> the society’s
inferiors. Under the name of eugenics, criminals and insane people were
clinically killed. The Nazis just borrowed the idea and applied it on a
larger scale with their gassing. Some time after this the WW2 happened,
the Allies emerged as the <em>good</em> side and everyone who supported
eugenics went mum. Crichton’s argument is that global warming today has
become like that. There is too much noise, media, politics, bias,
predictions and very less science.</p>
<p>I have to be honest here, I initially found the book highly
revolting. But, as always it’s good to see all sides of an issue. The
fiction is disappointing, but the book is a compelling read for the
issue it discusses. No matter on what side of this issue you stand there
are loads of interesting scientific trivia, claims and counter claims to
learn from the book.</p>
