<p>Saw Martin Scorcese's new sizzler <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0407887/">The Departed</a> last weekend. The movie is a remake of the Hong Kong thriller <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0338564/">Infernal Affairs</a>. The movie is about the double game played between an Irish mafia head Costello (Jack Nicholson) and the Boston State Police. Costello infiltrates the Special Investigation Unit of the police with his own man Colin (Matt Damon). The police also do the same to Costello's mob by injecting their seed Billy (Leonardo DiCaprio). When each side comes to know that they have a mole in them, they try to flush it out before the other does.</p>
<p>The movie is packed with an all star cast — Jack Nicholson, Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Mark Wahlberg and Martin Sheen. I was especially impressed with the powerful performances by DiCaprio and Wahlberg (he has made a superb comeback!). Jack Nicholson is at his usual best, he cakewalks through his role. Vera Farmiga is beautiful and plays the police psychologist who's in love with Colin and is also treating Billy. The story is edge-of-the-seat, slick, engaging and moves extremely fast. The 2½ hour movie whizzed by like it was an hour long. This is a good movie, I want to watch its original Infernal Affairs (<a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/miramax/infernal_affairs.html">trailer</a>) too sometime.</p>
