<p>Since it opened, I have been using the <strong><a href="http://www.bmtcinfo.com/site/BSBusServicesDetails.jsp?bsserviceid=1">Vayu Vajra</a></strong> bus service to get to and from the <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengaluru_International_Airport#Transport_to_the_airport">Bengaluru International Airport</a> (BIA)</strong>. The airport is situated 40KM outside the city in Devanahalli and this air-conditioned Volvo bus service has turned out to be a convenient and economical option for me to connect to it.</p>
<p>Officially called the <strong>Bengaluru International Airport Service (BIAS)</strong>, Vayu Vajra currently has 10+ routes covering most of the city and running all hours of the day. No matter where you stay, there should be a regional bus station nearby where you can catch these buses. I live in Jayanagar and the closest Vayu Vajra stop for me is the <strong>Jayanagar 4th Block</strong> bus station, which is a 5-minute drive from home. My dad drops me or picks me up from here in his car. Two Vayu Vajra routes: BIAS-5 and BIAS-12 go through this stop and so the waiting time for a bus is no more than 10-15 minutes. There is even a <strong>waiting room</strong> at the bus station for Vayu Vajra passengers with comfortable seats and space for luggage!</p>
<p>The BIAS buses are well designed, with comfortable seats and air conditioning, the latter is really needed in Bengaluru to have a smoke-free ride through rush-hour traffic (jams). There is lots of space in the middle of the bus to stack luggage. The middle doors are large and low enough to make loading and unloading of luggage easy.</p>
<p>No booking is needed, <strong>tickets</strong> can be bought on the bus from the conductor. On my recent trip, I paid a fare of ‚Çπ180 for the journey from Jayanagar 4th Block to the airport. This is an affordable fare for airline travellers, but can be a bit expensive for airport visitors since they will be paying it both to and from the airport. The travel duration depends on the traffic, mine takes about 1.5 hours during evening traffic.</p>
<p>The alternate means to get to the airport are bike, car, autorickshaw and taxi. Traveling to the airport by motorbike and car of the family can be stressful due to traffic jams and can be accident prone. Taking an autorickshaw is out of the question due to the distance, cost and times involved. (Do not even get me started about the shenanigans of auto drivers!) A taxi is convenient, but can be expensive, accident prone and one is left at the mercy of the driver. Compared against these, the Vayu Vajra service is very convenient, especially if one is traveling alone or with one co-traveler and is safe for women to travel alone at any hour.</p>
<p>To me, the Vayu Vajra service remains the best way to get to and from the airport. There are plans of connecting the Bengaluru Metro to the airport. If and when that happens, Vayu Vajra becomes redundant. I hope BMTC can keep this useful service running this well until then.</p>
<p>Information on the Vayu Vajra bus service can be found online: <a href="http://www.bmtcinfo.com/site/BSBusServicesRouteDetails.jsp?bsserviceid=1">routes</a>, <a href="http://www.bmtcinfo.com/site/BSBusServicesRouteDetailsTime.jsp?bsserviceid=1">timings</a> and <a href="http://www.bmtcinfo.com/site/BSBusServicesRouteDetailsFares.jsp?bsserviceid=1">fares</a>.</p>
