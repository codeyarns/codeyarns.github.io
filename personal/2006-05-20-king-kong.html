<p>Watched Peter Jackson’s remake of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Kong_(2005_film)"><strong>King
Kong</strong></a>. I hadn’t seen the original, so the story was new to
me. The movie is set in Depression era USA. Irked by his producers, Carl
Denham, a filmmaker sets off to a secret island to make a movie. All he
needs is a heroine, he convinces Ann Darrow who he meets on the street
to take this role. They leave in a hurry with the steamer crew assuming
they’re headed Far East to Singapore. Ann’s favorite playwright Driscoll
is also on the ship. They’re attracted to each other and start to fall
in love. Carl convinces the ship’s captain to head over to Skull Island,
the secret place whose map he has possession of. The ship crashes into
the rocks hidden by fog on the island. They discover that the island is
filled with crazy natives and has a humongous wall surrounding it. The
tribals steal away Ann and leave her as a sacrifice to the island’s
beast.</p>
<p>Kong, a prehistoric 25 foot gorilla is the partaker of this sacrifice
and he takes away Ann into the jungle just as the ship’s crew try to
rescue her. The film-makers and the crew decide to scour the jungle for
her. Meanwhile, Kong saves Ann from a group of carnivorous dinosaurs in
a vicious battle. Kong is a lonely ape, the last of his species and
starts to take a liking to Ann. She is also thankful for his help and
they share a beautiful sunset on a high cliff on the island. That night,
Driscoll saves her and is pursued by a very angry Kong. In the end, the
ape is captured using chloroform. With his Skull Island footage lost,
Carl sees the captured Kong as a chance to redeem his career. He takes
him to NYC and shows him as a mega attraction in the city. In the first
night’s show, Kong comes to his senses, breaks free of his chains and
goes out on a rampage. The army is called in to kill him. Ann finds him
and he flees with her to the top of the Empire State Building. As dawn
breaks over NYC, Kong is attacked by biplanes. He fights the biplanes
but is badly injured. He bids Ann an emotional farewell as he falls to
his death below.</p>
<p>King Kong is almost 3 hours long. I was dreading the length, but it
turned out to be surprisingly interesting. There are 3 different streams
going on in the movie — relationship between Kong and Ann, love of
Driscoll and Ann and finally Carl’s unstoppable passion to make his film
at any cost. The Skull Island scenes remind me of LOTR. The prehistoric
beasts of the island are done very well. The scenes between Kong and Ann
are actually emotional (surprise!). The climactic scenes of a wounded
Kong and Ann seeing the Sun rise over the skyscrapers of NYC is
fantastic. Jack Black (as filmmaker Carl) and Adrien Brody (as Driscoll)
are good. I loved the Eastman-like color that pervades the movie. This
is easily one of the better movies of 2005. I rate it as better than
Peter Jackson’s 3rd LOTR movie.</p>

<p>“And lo, the beast looked upon the face of beauty. And it stayed its
hand from killing. And from that day, it was as one dead.”</p>
