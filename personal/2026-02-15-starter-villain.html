<p>Substitute teacher <em>Charlie Fitzer</em> is barely making ends meet
in a Chicago suburb when he is contacted by <em>Morrison</em>, the
assistant of his long lost uncle and billionaire <em>Jake Baldwin</em>.
The uncle recently passed away, and in his will he is offering a new
life to Charlie if he can handle his memorial service. It is at this
memorial service that Charlie discovers that his rich uncle is not just
a parking lot baron, but a super-villain. He is also shocked to discover
that his pet cats <em>Hera</em> and <em>Persephone</em> are
super-intelligent spies created by his uncle and can communicate with
humans using keyboards. Charlie has to take over his uncle’s villain
<em>business</em> at his volcano island lair (where else?) in the
Caribbean, deal with a labor dispute of super-intelligent dolphins and
handle the other super-villains at their <em>Lombardy
Convocation</em>.</p>
<p><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starter_Villain"><strong>Starter
Villain</strong></a> is a funny, easy read by <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Scalzi"><strong>John
Scalzi</strong></a>. Charlie’s life in the suburbs and the initial
initiation into the villain business are really witty. The whole
“villainy as a business service” to the world is a clever idea. The
second and third acts get pretty meh though, with the fallout of the
Lombardy Convocation taking over the entire plot. The talking cats and
the swearing dolphins are a cool idea, but they get boring fast. This is
a good pick if you are looking for a light read to get out of a reading
slump.</p>

<h2 id="excerpts">Excerpts</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“Your uncle is in parking garages because they fund his more
important work,” Morrison said. “Which is to seek out, fund and create
the sort of technologies and services that bring disruptive change to
existing industrial and social paradigms, and offer them, on a
confidential basis, to interested businesses and governments.” “That’s a
great mission statement,” I said. “But it doesn’t say what he actually
did.” HE WAS A VILLAIN, Hera typed.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“He was of the opinion that animals didn’t have legal standing to
form unions,” Morrison said. “How do the cats feel about that?” “Most of
them are in management.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And what I heard was that villains, at least for the purposes of this
particular human resources presentation, were not bad people, and not
evil people. What they were, were professional disrupters: the people
who looked at systems and processes; found the weak spots, loopholes and
unintended consequences of each of them; and then exploited them, either
for their own advantage or the advantage of their client base. These
activities, Yang explained, were neither inherently good nor bad in
themselves—their “goodness” or “badness” was entirely dependent on the
perspective of the observer.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“A stupid villain threatens, Charlie. A smarter villain offers a
service.”</p>

<p>Napoleon said it the best: “Never interrupt your enemy when he is
making a mistake.”</p>
