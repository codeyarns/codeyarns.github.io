<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/4 (Great lines, music, Bogart and Burgman
make this a must watch!)</p>

<p>So says Rick when he sees his old lover Ilsa walk into his bar. The
movie is <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casablanca_%28film%29">Casablanca</a>,
the time is early World War II and the place is Casablanca in Morocco,
Africa. Casablanca is teeming with European refugees who have run away
from their countries desperate to obtain an exit visa from here
(unoccupied French territory) and get into America. They are all running
away from the expanding Nazi armies.</p>
<p>Rick (Humphrey Bogart) escaped from Europe after the woman he loved
ditched him, he has now settled in Casablanca and runs a bar. Fatefully,
he gets his hands on two transit letters that allow any two people to
get out with no restrictions. Incidentally, the same day his old lover
Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) walks into his bar with her partner. Ilsa’s
partner Victor Lazlo turns out to be a guy working on a resistance
movement against the Nazis, a cause that Rick himself is sympathetic to.
But, Lazlo and Ilsa are denied exit visas. To complicate matters, the
German influence is already growing in the city and the Nazis are sure
to send Lazlo to their concentration camps if they catch him. In these
desperate situations, the couple request Rick to help them with his
transit letters. Rick turns then down saying he does not care what
happens to them. Will he have a change of heart?</p>
<p>The movie is really old, shot in B&amp;W. The story with its elements
of love during war is very intriguing. Bogart seems very stony and
always talks in a monotone. Ingrid is stunningly beautiful in this
movie, I just melted. The famous song <em><a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_Time_Goes_By_%28song%29">As Time
Goes By</a></em> appears in this movie. This is certainly a movie not to
be missed.</p>
