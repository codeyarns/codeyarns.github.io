<p>I came across this book while I was looking for <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Searching_for_Bobby_Fischer">Searching
For Bobby Fischer</a>. That book+movie is about chess whizkid Josh
Waitzkin who went on to be the US Chess Champion many times. This book
<a
href="http://www.amazon.com/Art-Learning-Journey-Optimal-Performance/dp/0743277465/">The
Art Of Learning: An Inner Journey To Optimal Performance</a> is written
by the subject of that book Josh Waitzkin, who’s now much older. That
book and the popular movie which was made after that brought a lot of
fame to Waitzkin and (according to him) destroyed his chess game.
Looking for something peaceful after that, he learnt <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tai_Chi_Chuan">Tai Chi</a>. His Tai
Chi master invited him to learn <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pushing_hands">Tai Chi Push
Hands</a>, the martial art style of Tai Chi. Using the experiences from
his chess career, Waitzkin was able to hone his Push Hands skills well
enough to win the Tai Chi World Championship.</p>
<p>This book is part (auto)biography and part philosophical. Using his
life’s ups and downs as the analogy, Waitzkin tries to distill the
elements which help in learning (anything). Themes touched upon include
how to start learning something new, improve in it, enjoy it, increase
the performance in it and finally excel in it. All through the book this
discourse uses chess and martial arts metaphors from his own life for
achieving this. I found the book quite useful and might read it again in
a few years.</p>
<p>Should you be reading this book? Check out this <a
href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lj1gxz5puaQ">short video</a> (10
min) and this <a
href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTZS3SqpT-o">Authors@Google
talk</a> (56 min) where he talks about his life and the book and decide
for yourself.</p>
