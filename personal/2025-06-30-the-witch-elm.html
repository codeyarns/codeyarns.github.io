<p>I am into what seems to be 100 pages of a single afternoon
conversation between the narrator (and prime suspect) Toby and his
cousins Susanna and Leon. And I am wondering how is it that I am still
so engaged to see this conversation to its long drawn conclusion and
hopefully discover something that sheds more light on who committed the
murder. That is kind of pull that author <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tana_French"><strong>Tana
French</strong></a> has in her psychological thriller <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Witch_Elm"><strong>The Witch
Elm</strong></a>.</p>
<p>The plot is threadbare, in fact there is nothing to it: after a
near-death run-in with burglars, Toby (along with his fiance Melissa)
move in to the Ivy House to take care of his uncle Hugo in his dying
days. At one of their large-family weekend meetups, one of the grandkids
discovers a skull in the hole of an old witch elm tree in the garden.
Detectives come by to tear up the garden and discover that the body of
Toby’s highschool jock friend Dominic has been lying in that tree for a
decade. As the days tick by, pieces of evidence that the detective
Rafferty puts together starts to point the finger of suspicion at
Toby.</p>
<p>Tana is masterful in constructing her world and pulling her reader
into that. And once we are in there, she is able to convincingly suspend
our disbelief and you too start believing that, yes maybe, the innocent
Toby did commit that murder and does not remember it. She sets up such
deep and long setups that you forget that you are being deceived and
just enjoy the ride. This book was a delightful experience to lose
myself in the depths of Toby’s mind and memories, his idyllic childhood
days at the Ivy House, the big family drama, and how questionable our
memory can be. If not for the wholly unnecessary extra murder thrown in
at the end, this would have been a near perfect thriller.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/5</p>
