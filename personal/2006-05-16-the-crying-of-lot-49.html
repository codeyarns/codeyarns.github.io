<p>Trying to put into words the experience of reading <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crying_of_Lot_49"><strong>The
Crying Of Lot 49</strong></a> is extremely hard. This is an early novel
by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Pynchon"><strong>Thomas
Pynchon</strong></a>. Set in 1960s California, the story is said from
the viewpoint of one <em>Oedipa Mass</em>. She is called upon to
co-execute the will of her former rich boyfriend <em>Inverarity</em>.
While working on that, she comes across an intriguing symbol of a muted
post horn in a bar bathroom one night. She begins to try to find out
what it represents. Over the next several days as she doggedly pursues
the real meaning of the symbol, she discovers an underbelly to the world
around her, an alternative postage system that has existed since
medieval times and still being used today. In the end, the existence of
her discoveries is left hanging in the air. It could be real or she
could be imagining things.</p>
<p>The book is quite thin. Had it been any thicker I <em>might</em> have
given up. Pynchon’s work is dense, complex, bizarre, dreamy, funny and
sarcastic. The reader discovers slowly page by page, bit by bit along
with Oedipa a bizarre world and what the symbol might mean. The world
presented by Pynchon is rich in detail and here the real and imaginary
combine and become indistinguishable. What the book leads to might be
either gibberish or prodigal, but the journey is damn tripping. I’ll bet
not everyone can describe this book or what it really means in a
definite way. I need to reread this book someday.</p>
<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 3/4</p>
