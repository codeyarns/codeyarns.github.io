<p>Where was this gem all these years?! Saw <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119217/">Good Will Hunting</a> which stars Matt Damon and Robbie Williams. Will (Matt Damon) is a janitor at the MIT who is a prodigy in math, science and arts. He's an orphan and has been through a troubled childhood. When Prof. Lambeau (a Fields Medallist) leaves a tough problem to his class, Will solves it during the night and leaves the answer on the board. The surprised professor tracks down the secret problem solver and is eager to showcase his genius to the world. Meanwhile, Will who has a violent background, fights with a cop and gets thrown into jail. The professor gets him out on the condition that he attend therapy every week. Will agrees but screws around with the minds of every therapist. Meanwhile he's fallen in love with Skylar (Minnie Driver), a Harvard student. Lambeau finally convinces his old friend Sean (Robin Williams) to hold therapy sessions for Will. Though they get off on a rocky start (Will verbally abuses Sean's dead wife), after several tries Sean is able to open up Will's pent up emotions. Lambeau wants Will to use his prodigious talent. Skylar wants him to move with her to CA. Sean wants him to do what is right to him. Will wants to return to his former simple life. What does Will do?</p>
<p>This movie is scripted by the actors Matt Damon and Ben Affleck (they won an Oscar for this screenplay). Unbelievable isn't it? The story is splendid and definitely makes one think about life. On the one hand it is about Will rediscovering himself, opening up his pent up emotions and discovering what he wants from life. But, the movie is also about Sean, renewing his life (he's depressed after his wife's death) through his sessions with Will. The actings performances from Damon and Williams (another Oscar for his role here) are top class. The movie is a bit lengthy (2+ hours). This is a must watch!</p>
