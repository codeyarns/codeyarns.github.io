<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Westing_Game"><strong>The
Westing Game</strong></a> is a mystery book that is apparently used in
many (middle?) schools in the US. It is written by <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen_Raskin"><strong>Ellen
Raskin</strong></a>, who is famous for creating book covers. The story
begins at <em>Sunset Towers</em>, a brand new apartment complex built by
the side of Lake Michigan. 16 lucky people are chosen to live and
conduct their business amidst these luxurious settings for a nominal
rent. Pretty soon a murder is discovered at the mansion that overlooks
these homes. The will of that deceased tycoon <em>Sam Westing</em>, says
that all 16 of them are actually his heirs, but only the one who figures
out who is the murderer amongst them shall inherit his fortune. To solve
this post-mordem mystery, his will has also left clues for each pair of
these residents. Shut in by a snowstorm, the residents try to solve
their clues to find out who amongst them is the murderer.</p>
<p><em>How can a murdered man have his own murderer accused and named in
his will?</em> That premise is intriguing, I am not going to lie. But, a
majority of the book is the daily mundane lives of these boring
characters who do not seem to have any real life outside of Sunset
Towers. The clues are pithy, except when they are finally put together
in the end - to create the song <em>America the Beautiful</em>! The
worst part of the book is watching these dumb-as-doornails residents try
to solve these clues every day in the dumbest (but over confident) ways
possible. The book is somewhat interesting at the very end, as the
murder is solved by the precocious shin-splitting <em>Turtle
Wexler</em>.</p>
<p>This book is supposedly popular in US middle school classrooms.
Reading it as an adult, I could not find any redeeming characteristic in
this book. I mean, Mr. Sherlock Holmes is more than up to the task, if
they need a fantastic middle-school level mystery series. Have I lost my
childhood innocence? I am not so sure, since I enjoy a lot of the books
I read to my kids, but this one does not make that cut.</p>
