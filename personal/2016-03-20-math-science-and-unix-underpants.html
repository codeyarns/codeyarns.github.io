<p><strong>FoxTrot</strong> is a fun comic strip that I have been reading for years in the random newspaper or website. Being a family-centric heavily-syndicated comic strip, I had no idea it had geek credentials. Imagine my surprise when I ran into a Foxtrot collection of strips titled <strong>Math, Science, and Unix Underpants</strong>! I simply had to read it!</p>
<p>Going by the strips in this collection, <strong>Bill Amend</strong> does not water down the nerd quotient of Jason Fox and his geeky adventures in the strip. There is no holding back, it is full of math formulae, trivia and lots of computer references. The author has a degree in physics and it really shows in the physics strips. I had a great time with this book. If you are looking for an excellent way to relax, do not miss this one. Also, if you are looking for some great math/science/computer strips to share with school students or fellow geeks, this book is a goldmine.</p>
<p>PS: Switch off the lights and you have a surprise waiting for you on the book cover in the darkness! ;-)</p>
