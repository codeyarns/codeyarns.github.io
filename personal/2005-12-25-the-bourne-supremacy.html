<p>The Bourne Supremacy is the sequel to the movie The Bourne Identity. The movie starts off in Goa where Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) and his girlfriend Marie have relocated. He still cannot remember everything from before his amnesia but has now started to see flashes of his past. In Goa he is chased down by someone and in the process Marie is killed. He lands up in Europe to find that he is being framed for the murder of CIA agents, a murder that he didn't commit. Bourne is again on the run now, all over Europe and Russia, from the CIA who think he is the murderer and from the real killers who want to finish him off. In the process, he also gets to discover his true identity and some of his past.</p>
<p>The first 20 minutes of the movie are shot in Goa. Thankfully, a realistic image of small town India is shown instead of some overhype. Bourne even drives a dusty Maruti Gypsy! This movie looks and feels just as good as the first one. The action is gritty, pace is fast, camerawork is excellent and the locales in Europe are shot brilliantly, all in that light sepia-like tone. The car chase at the end in Moscow is the tops. If you liked the first movie, this one should also be neat.</p>
