<p><em>“For it was my master who taught me not only how very little I
knew but also that any wisdom to which I might ever aspire could consist
only in realizing more fully the infinity of my ignorance”</em> – Karl
Popper</p>
<p>The infinity of my ignorance about plants further increased as I read
<a
href="https://www.harpercollins.com/products/the-light-eaters-zoe-schlanger?variant=41096248295458"><strong>The
Light Eaters</strong></a> by <strong>Zoe Schlanger</strong>. This book
looks at the spate of astonishing discoveries being made about plants in
the last few decades that are showing how little we know about them.</p>
<p>The plants from my school science classes were essentially a green
machine that grew from seeds, roots and leaves that used sunlight and
water to produce our food. Scientists are now discovering that plants
are able to communicate with each other, can feel touch, listen, have
memory, interact actively with animals, can change themselves to mimic
other plants, have a social life and even adapt to plants of their own
kin. Zoe talks to the real scientific pioneers in the field of plant
science, goes on scientific expeditions with them into jungles and
describes the many strange and mysterious plants that are exhibiting
these incredible behaviors.</p>
<p>The book demolished my notion that plants are boring. They are 80% by
weight of the Earth’s living matter and have been here before all animal
life and will probably be still here after we are gone. Plants from
millions of years ago, like ferns and gingko are still here with us.
Ferns especially are insane beings, it was a revelation for me that they
produce cork-screw sperm that swim in water to mate with female fern
eggs!</p>
<p>We think of them as static, but they are in constant (slow) motion,
probing air and soil to thrive. They certainly don’t have brains, but
seem to be able to sense, be aware and able to adapt to their
environment. There is an entire field of phytoacoustics on how plants
react to sounds. Or vernalization, where plants use their memory of
winter to be able to sprout.</p>
<p>Plants also actively interact with animals, both being eaten and also
as the predator. But mostly they coexist, sometimes even conscripting
them (ants) to be their bodyguards, paying them with syrup and lodging.
Probably the biggest star of the book is <strong>boquila</strong>, the
chameleon vine, that can mimic the leaves of any host plant it swirls
itself around! How can a plant do this unless there is some sight or
genetic transfer at play?!</p>
<p>The popular book <strong>The Secret Life of Plants</strong> brought
shame to this field, with its revelations that were non-scientific and
non-reproducible. This book on the other hand is on stronger footing,
with most of the findings being backed by solid science and real
scientists. There are only a couple of instances where the author
sympathizes with the point of view of some pseudo-scientists or
philosophers, which I found unsettling. The biggest blunder in the book
was the lack of pictures. I found myself looking up photos of every one
of the mentioned plants and it boggles my mind why they couldn’t put
those in the book in the first place! Zoe is a great writer, able to
wield the power of the language to draw the reader in and amaze us all
over again about plants.</p>
<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 4/5</p>
