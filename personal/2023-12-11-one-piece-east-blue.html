<p>The appearance of the live action <em>One Piece</em> TV series on
Netflix spurred me to read a manga after a really long time. I picked up
the tome <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Piece"><strong>One
Piece: East Blue</strong></a>, which is a compilation of the first 3
volumes of the manga. Created by <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiichiro_Oda"><strong>Eiichiro
Oda</strong></a> at a surprisingly young age of 22, this manga has
turned to be the best selling manga series of all time.</p>
<p>The story is a set in a different fantasy world and time, where the
land is surrounded by various oceans and pirates rule the seas. Not all
pirates are bad and our hero <em>Monkey D. Luffy</em> aspires to be the
king of (good) pirates and to find the legendary <em>One Piece</em>
treasure. He gains the superpower of super-stretching after eating the
magical <em>Devil Fruit</em> of the gum-gum tree in his childhood. And
once he is older, he is off on the seas to gather a motley set of
characters to form his crew. These adventures and the fights with
potential villains keeps the story chugging along.</p>
<p>I read the English version of East Blue published by Viz Media. This
version reads just like the original manga, i.e., back-to-front with
helpful directions for readers new to manga on how to read it. This tome
has the first 3 volumes: <em>Romance Dawn</em>, <em>Buggy the Clown</em>
and <em>Don’t Get Fooled Again</em>. The unique setting of this world,
the characters and the non-stop sarcastic humor are top notch. The
drawing is good and the action panels would satisfy the younger crowd I
would assume. The manga runs fast and once you are invested in the
story, it is easy to finish the 600+ pages easily. However, I do not
think I would read the series since I am bit too old for the
<em>shonen</em> level slapstick gags and will only be looking at
<em>seinen</em> manga in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 3/4</p>
