<p>I recently discovered that Casio had lots of new watches now that could run forever (using solar power) and also synchronize time using Bluetooth to a smartphone. This fit my preference for a wristwatch that I can just pick and wear and it always shows the correct time and is always charged. So I had to get one and I chose the <a href="https://www.casio.com/us/watches/gshock/product.GA-B2100CY-1A/"><strong>Casio G-Shock GB-B2100</strong></a>. More accurately I tried two models in this lineup: * <em>GAB2100CY-1A</em> which is all black, but has yellow hands. * <em>GAB2100C-9A</em> which is all yellow, but with a black face.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Case size</strong>: At 48.5 x 45.4 x 11.9 mm, the thickness was OK, but the size was a tad large for my tiny wrist.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Weight</strong>: At 52 g, it felt very light, especially with its medium size.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Analog hands</strong>: They are big and bright yellow and easily readable. They spin themselves to the right time when the time is set using the phone app. My only complaint is the that when the long and short hands are in opposite directions, the bottom of the long hand can obscure the short hand. They could have easily designed the hands so they did not have such long overhangs at the bottom of each one.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Digital display</strong>: This is a 2-line display with seconds on the top line and date/day/time and other information displayed on the bottom line.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the GAB2100C-9A, the display is the classic Casio positive LCD display and it is clear and legible.</li>
<li>In the GAB2100CY-1A, a negative display is used and it is apparently the dimmest one they have called TN-LCD. It is barely readable even in sunlight and impossible to read in the low light. I would avoid this watch if the readability is important.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Light</strong>: The light is bright and is located in the bottom-right corner. I have had to resort to using it to read the digital display, the display is truly that bad!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Solar charging</strong>: The dial of this watch has a transparent solar panel and charges itself.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Bluetooth</strong>: Install the <strong>Casio Watches</strong> app on the phone to communicate with it using Bluetooth.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Casio Watches</strong>: This is Casio‚Äôs smartphone app for both Android and iOS. I like that pretty much all the settings of the watch can be done right from this app itself. Supported features include setting alarms, setting timers, setting reminders, setting the world time zone, automatic time synchronization with the phone and a phone finder.</p></li>
</ul>
