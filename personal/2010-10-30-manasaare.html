<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 3/4 (Manasaare is an intelligent and
entertaining existentialist experiment from the minds of Yograj Bhat and
Pawan Kumar.)</p>
<p>From the imaginative duo of writer Pawan Kumar and director Yograj
Bhat comes the 2009 movie <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manasaare"><strong>Manasaare</strong></a>
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manasaare">ಮನಸಾರೆ</a>). In the
movie, Manohar (Diganth) is an orphan who sees society as full of
puppets living their life according to others’ expectations. People
start calling him harebrained when he starts to speak his mind.
Ironically for him, he is mistaken for a mentally unsound murderer and
taken to a mental health institution named <strong>Kaamanabillu</strong>
(Rainbow). His pleas that he is not insane are ignored and he makes
several failed attempts to escape. He meets Devika (Aindrita Ray), a
female patient and it is love at first sight. Devika is at the hospital
due to repressed hatred of men caused by childhood atrocities by her
father. Manohar tries to win her heart and escape from the institution
with her.</p>
<p>Manasaare has such cool surreal and heretical moments that it is a
wonder how it got funded and made into a commercial movie. Manasaare and
<a href="2010-10-17-pancharangi.html"><strong>Pancharangi</strong></a>
clearly fall into the same basket, with Manasaare going much deeper into
the introspection of who we are and how we live. Not surprisingly, the
protagonist Manohar finds his worldview at home in a mental institution,
rather than out in the real world where people find truth discomfiting.
His roommates Raju Talikote and Dollar provide the perfect Yin for
Manohar’s Yang. Talikote is mentally sound, but finds comfort living
amongst people whose insanity have cures instead of living in a society
whose insanity has no cure. Diganth and Raju Talikote have acted
excellently. Pawan Kumar who plays the comically deranged Dollar is also
the writer of the movie. (His experience of writing and creating
Manasaare can be read <a
href="http://pawantheactor.com/?page_id=631">here</a>.) Aindrita Ray is
a doll and her role requires very little talking. Mano Murthy has
created some lilting tunes which benefit from some of the best lyrics
writing by Jayant Kaikini. My favorites are the songs Ello
Maleyaagideyindu (It has rained somewhere today) and Naa Naguva
Modalene. In the climax, Manohar returns back to society and is pushed
to insanity when people mock him and label him insane. His mental
dilemma is resolved in a well shot intelligent ending, one of the
coolest I have seen in a long time. Manasaare sports an original story,
but does have strong shades of Upendra’s <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_%28Kannada_film%29"><strong>A</strong></a>
and <a href="2006-12-05-one-flew-over-the-cuckoos-nest.html"><strong>One
Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest</strong></a>. Thankfully, it is never takes
itself too seriously, resulting in an entertaining romantic comedy. This
is an intelligent experiment by Yograj Bhat and Pawan Kumar that should
be watched.</p>
