<p>Brave New World and 1984 are 2 books which I have been wanting to
read for a long time. One is in an Utopian world and the other in
dystopia. I finally got around to reading <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brave_New_World"><strong>Brave New
World</strong></a> written by <strong>Aldous Huxley</strong>. This
sci-fi work is set in an Utopian future of Earth in the 26th
century.</p>
<p>Family as an entity no longer exists. All babies are
<em>decanted</em> artificially by fusing ovules and sperms and growing
them. <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenics"><strong>Eugenics</strong></a>
is used to create 5 <em>castes</em> of humans known as Alpha, Beta,
Gamma, Delta and Epsilon, ranging respectively from intelligent beings
to morons. Each class is imbibed with the characteristics required for
their future work by conditioning them (thinking for the Alphas, manual
labour for the Epsilons and so on). <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep-learning"><strong>Hypnopædia</strong></a>
(sleep-learning) is extensively used while rearing children to ensure
that they think in a predestined way all their life. Since they’re all
artificially grown, the concept of parents or siblings doesn’t exist.
Every person is <em>a cell in the social body</em>. Everyone takes
artificial agents to ensure youthful beauty until their dying breath.
<em>Everyone belongs to everyone else</em>, i.e. sex is promiscuous.
Living with a single person for life is unheard of. There are no
politics, war, family, literature or religions. <em>Soma</em> (a drug)
is used by everyone to stay blissful all day. Everyone is happy.</p>
<p>In this world is Bernard Marx, an Alpha who is dating a beautiful
Beta named Lenina. He is tired of the artificial life and takes her on a
trip to a <em>savage reservation</em> in New Mexico. These are
inhospitable parts of the planet where uncivilized people have been
allowed to stay as they had centuries ago. Here, Marx runs into a savage
child named John, who is actually a child of a civilized mom. He takes
him back to London. Meanwhile, Lenina is feeling love towards this
savage. In the New World, John observes how his life in the forests
differs so much from the controlled life in London. He has feelings
towards Lenina too, but is turned off by her behaviour. Everything comes
to a head when he causes a ruckus at a hospital. He is taken to meet
Mustapha Mond, the Resident World Controller (think Architect from
<em>Matrix Reloaded</em>) along with Marx and his fellow thinker
Helmholtz. In his office, John and Mond confront each other and it leads
to an enthralling discussion about the gains and losses by living like
they are in this controlled artificial society. In the end, Marx and
Helmholtz are transferred to distant islands and John moves back to a
solitary life in the wild.</p>
<p>Written in 1932, Brave New World is a surprisingly good read even
today. (The book is available online <a
href="http://www.hedweb.com/huxley/bnw/">here</a>.) The pace is quick,
the flavour is light. Huxley is brilliant in recreating his Utopian
world. The book can be roughly divided into 3 parts. The 1st introduces
the new world in rich detail. The 2nd introduces the protagonists and
the last part deals with the debate between Mond and John. The last part
is what makes delightful reading. The reader finally learns how this
world came to be, how humanity slowly gave up its freedom in exchange
for happiness. This is a thrilling and brilliant work brimming with
ideas.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/4</p>
<p><strong>Excerpts:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mond to John: “The world’s stable now. People are happy; they get
what they want, and they never want what they can’t get. They’re well
off; they’re safe; they’re never ill; they’re not afraid of death;
they’re blissfully ignorant of passion and old age; they’re plagued with
no mothers or fathers; they’ve got no wives, or children, or lovers to
feel strongly about; they’re so conditioned that they practically can’t
help behaving as they ought to behave. And if anything should go wrong,
there’s soma. Which you go and chuck out of the window in the name of
liberty, Mr. Savage.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Mond explaining why even science is controlled in this world: “I’m
interested in truth, I like science. But truth’s a menace, science is a
public danger. As dangerous as it’s been beneficent. It has given us the
stablest equilibrium in history. China’s was hopelessly insecure by
comparison; even the primitive matriarchies weren’t steadier than we
are. Thanks, l repeat, to science. But we can’t allow science to undo
its own good work. That’s why we so carefully limit the scope of its
researches […]. We don’t allow it to deal with any but the most
immediate problems of the moment. All other enquiries are most
sedulously discouraged. It’s curious,” he went on after a little pause,
“to read what people in the time of Our Ford used to write about
scientific progress. They seemed to have imagined that it could be
allowed to go on indefinitely, regardless of everything else. Knowledge
was the highest good, truth the supreme value; all the rest was
secondary and subordinate. True, ideas were beginning to change even
then. Our Ford himself did a great deal to shift the emphasis from truth
and beauty to comfort and happiness. Mass production demanded the shift.
Universal happiness keeps the wheels steadily turning; truth and beauty
can’t. And, of course, whenever the masses seized political power, then
it was happiness rather than truth and beauty that mattered. Still, in
spite of everything, unrestricted scientific research was still
permitted. People still went on talking about truth and beauty as though
they were the sovereign goods. Right up to the time of the Nine Years’
War. That made them change their tune all right. What’s the point of
truth or beauty or knowledge when the anthrax bombs are popping all
around you? That was when science first began to be controlled–after the
Nine Years’ War. People were ready to have even their appetites
controlled then. Anything for a quiet life. We’ve gone on controlling
ever since. It hasn’t been very good for truth, of course. But it’s been
very good for happiness. One can’t have something for nothing. Happiness
has got to be paid for.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>From the bathroom came an unpleasant and characteristic sound.<br />
“Is there anything the matter?” Helmholtz called. There was no answer.
The unpleasant sound was repeated, twice; there was silence. Then, with
a click the bathroom door opened and, very pale, the Savage emerged. “I
say,” Helmholtz exclaimed solicitously, “you do look ill, John!” “Did
you eat something that didn’t agree with you?” asked Bernard. The Savage
nodded. “I ate civilization.”</p>
