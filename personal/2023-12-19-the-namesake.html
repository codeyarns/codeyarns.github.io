<p>I had been meaning to read <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Namesake_(novel)"><strong>The
Namesake</strong></a> for a long time, having gifted it to a friend on
impulse more than a decade ago when I was a student living in tropical
Singapore. Reading it finally now, as a legal working immigrant with a
family in the US, I seriously doubt that I would have been sucker
punched by its impact in the same way back then. For <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jhumpa_Lahiri"><strong>Jhumpa
Lahiri</strong></a> gave me one of the strongest emotional experiences I
have ever felt from a book in these pages!</p>
<p>The book is notionally a bildungsroman about <em>Gogol Gaguli</em>,
an ABCD born to Bengali immigrant parents on the East Coast. However for
me, I experienced the story through the eyes of his mother Ashima, who
marries Ashoke, uproots herself from the warm comfort of her parents’
home in Calcutta to live alone with a PhD in the cold of Cambridge. It
is the lonely experience of her months of pregnancy and her delivery in
a US hospital in the opening of the novel that gripped me like a vice
and never let me go.</p>
<p>The book is named so because of why Ashoke had named his son after
the Russian author Nikolai Gogol, whose book had saved his life in a
train accident. Not aware of this reason, Gogol struggles with his name,
and thus his ABCD identity throughout his childhood, ultimately changing
his name officially to Nikhil. The reader lives through the trajectory
of this family, as Ashoke gets a job in academia, Ashima gains
confidence to live in a foreign land, they get a home in the suburbs,
have a daughter named Sonia and finally the career and relationships of
Gogol.</p>
<p>This was easily the best book I read this year and probably one of
the best books I have ever read. With the vivid descriptions of the
South Asian culture, family, and struggles I felt like this was my own
story in the last half decade in the US. Also, Ashima’s character and
her travails are handled with great care and gentleness, in a way only a
female author could. And in Chapter 7, after a slowburn, the author
delivers such a tragic blow to Ashima that is unforgettable. There are
so many pages where I paused, savored the words or the feeling before
continuing. Jhumpa is a fantastic craftsmith of words, as we have
already seen in <a
href="2013-10-06-interpreter-of-maladies.html"><strong>Interpreter of
Maladies</strong></a>, but when combined here with the South Asian
immigrant experience she creates a novel that I seriously doubt will
ever be bested in this category.</p>

<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/4</p>
<h2 id="excerpts">Excerpts</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Like a kiss or caress in a Hindi movie, a husband’s name is something
intimate and therefore unspoken, cleverly patched over. And so, instead
of saying Ashoke’s name, she utters the interrogative that has come to
replace it, which translates roughly as “Are you listening to me?”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Glancing at the floor where visitors customarily removed their
slippers, she noticed, beside two sets of chappals, a pair of men’s
shoes that were not like any she’d ever seen on the streets and trams
and buses of Calcutta, or even in the windows of Bata. They were brown
shoes with black heels and off-white laces and stitching. […] And as her
mother continued to sing her praises, Ashima, unable to resist a sudden
and overwhelming urge, stepped into the shoes at her feet. Lingering
sweat from the owner’s feet mingled with hers, causing her heart to
race; it was the closest thing she had ever experienced to the touch of
a man.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>At the designated hour she was seated on a piri that her father had
decorated, hoisted five feet off the ground, carried out to meet the
groom. She had hidden her face with a heart-shaped betel leaf, kept her
head bent low until she had circled him seven times. […] Eight thousand
miles away in Cambridge, she has come to know him.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Ashoke is indifferent to such indulgences. He neither smokes nor
drinks alcohol of any kind. Ashima is the one who keeps all their
addresses, in a small notebook she carries in her purse. It has never
occurred to him to buy his wife flowers.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Without a single grandparent or parent or uncle or aunt at her side,
the baby’s birth, like most everything else in America, feels somehow
haphazard, only half true. As she strokes and suckles and studies her
son, she can’t help but pity him. She has never known of a person
entering the world so alone, so deprived.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In Bengali the word for pet name is daknam, meaning, literally, the
name by which one is called, by friends, family, and other intimates, at
home and in other private, unguarded moments. Pet names are a persistent
remnant of childhood, a reminder that life is not always so serious, so
formal, so complicated. They are a reminder, too, that one is not all
things to all people. They all have pet names. Ashima’s pet name is
Monu, Ashoke’s is Mithu, and even as adults, these are the names by
which they are known in their respective families, the names by which
they are adored and scolded and missed and loved.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In some senses Ashoke and Ashima live the lives of the extremely
aged, those for whom everyone they once knew and loved is lost, those
who survive and are consoled by memory alone.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>At times his name, an entity shapeless and weightless, manages
nevertheless to distress him physically, like the scratchy tag of a
shirt he has been forced permanently to wear.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And suddenly the sound of his pet name, uttered by his father as he
has been accustomed to hearing it all his life, means something
completely new, bound up with a catastrophe he has unwittingly embodied
for years. “Is that what you think of when you think of me?” Gogol asks
him. “Do I remind you of that night?” “Not at all,” his father says
eventually, one hand going to his ribs, a habitual gesture that has
baffled Gogol until now. “You remind me of everything that
followed.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>She has saved her dead parents’ letters on the top shelf of her
closet, in a large white purse she used to carry in the seventies until
the strap broke. Once a year she dumps the letters onto her bed and goes
through them, devoting an entire day to her parents’ words, allowing
herself a good cry. She revisits their affection and concern, conveyed
weekly, faithfully, across continents—all the bits of news that had had
nothing to do with her life in Cambridge but which had sustained her in
those days nevertheless.</p>
