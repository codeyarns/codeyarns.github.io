<p>I had been meaning to read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Namesake_(novel)"><strong>The Namesake</strong></a> for a long time, having gifted it to a friend on impulse more than a decade ago when I was a student living in tropical Singapore. Reading it finally now, as a legal working immigrant with a family in the US, I seriously doubt that I would have been sucker punched by its impact in the same way back then. For <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jhumpa_Lahiri"><strong>Jhumpa Lahiri</strong></a> gave me one of the strongest emotional experiences I have ever felt from a book in these pages!</p>
<p>The book is notionally a bildungsroman about <em>Gogol Gaguli</em>, an ABCD born to Bengali immigrant parents on the East Coast. However for me, I experienced the story through the eyes of his mother Ashima, who marries Ashoke, uproots herself from the warm comfort of her parents’ home in Calcutta to live alone with a PhD in the cold of Cambridge. It is the lonely experience of her months of pregnancy and her delivery in a US hospital in the opening of the novel that gripped me like a vice and never let me go.</p>
<p>The book is named so because of why Ashoke had named his son after the Russian author Nikolai Gogol, whose book had saved his life in a train accident. Not aware of this reason, Gogol struggles with his name, and thus his ABCD identity throughout his childhood, ultimately changing his name officially to Nikhil. The reader lives through the trajectory of this family, as Ashoke gets a job in academia, Ashima gains confidence to live in a foreign land, they get a home in the suburbs, have a daughter named Sonia and finally the career and relationships of Gogol.</p>
<p>This was easily the best book I read this year and probably one of the best books I have ever read. With the vivid descriptions of the South Asian culture, family, and struggles I felt like this was my own story in the last half decade in the US. Also, Ashima’s character and her travails are handled with great care and gentleness, in a way only a female author could. And in Chapter 7, after a slowburn, the author delivers such a tragic blow to Ashima that is unforgettable. There are so many pages where I paused, savored the words or the feeling before continuing. Jhumpa is a fantastic craftsmith of words, as we have already seen in <a href="2013-10-06-interpreter-of-maladies.html"><strong>Interpreter of Maladies</strong></a>, but when combined here with the South Asian immigrant experience she creates a novel that I seriously doubt will ever be bested in this category.</p>

<h2 id="excerpts">Excerpts</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Like a kiss or caress in a Hindi movie, a husband’s name is something intimate and therefore unspoken, cleverly patched over. And so, instead of saying Ashoke’s name, she utters the interrogative that has come to replace it, which translates roughly as “Are you listening to me?”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Glancing at the floor where visitors customarily removed their slippers, she noticed, beside two sets of chappals, a pair of men’s shoes that were not like any she’d ever seen on the streets and trams and buses of Calcutta, or even in the windows of Bata. They were brown shoes with black heels and off-white laces and stitching. […] And as her mother continued to sing her praises, Ashima, unable to resist a sudden and overwhelming urge, stepped into the shoes at her feet. Lingering sweat from the owner’s feet mingled with hers, causing her heart to race; it was the closest thing she had ever experienced to the touch of a man.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>At the designated hour she was seated on a piri that her father had decorated, hoisted five feet off the ground, carried out to meet the groom. She had hidden her face with a heart-shaped betel leaf, kept her head bent low until she had circled him seven times. […] Eight thousand miles away in Cambridge, she has come to know him.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Ashoke is indifferent to such indulgences. He neither smokes nor drinks alcohol of any kind. Ashima is the one who keeps all their addresses, in a small notebook she carries in her purse. It has never occurred to him to buy his wife flowers.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Without a single grandparent or parent or uncle or aunt at her side, the baby’s birth, like most everything else in America, feels somehow haphazard, only half true. As she strokes and suckles and studies her son, she can’t help but pity him. She has never known of a person entering the world so alone, so deprived.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In Bengali the word for pet name is daknam, meaning, literally, the name by which one is called, by friends, family, and other intimates, at home and in other private, unguarded moments. Pet names are a persistent remnant of childhood, a reminder that life is not always so serious, so formal, so complicated. They are a reminder, too, that one is not all things to all people. They all have pet names. Ashima’s pet name is Monu, Ashoke’s is Mithu, and even as adults, these are the names by which they are known in their respective families, the names by which they are adored and scolded and missed and loved.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In some senses Ashoke and Ashima live the lives of the extremely aged, those for whom everyone they once knew and loved is lost, those who survive and are consoled by memory alone.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>At times his name, an entity shapeless and weightless, manages nevertheless to distress him physically, like the scratchy tag of a shirt he has been forced permanently to wear.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And suddenly the sound of his pet name, uttered by his father as he has been accustomed to hearing it all his life, means something completely new, bound up with a catastrophe he has unwittingly embodied for years. “Is that what you think of when you think of me?” Gogol asks him. “Do I remind you of that night?” “Not at all,” his father says eventually, one hand going to his ribs, a habitual gesture that has baffled Gogol until now. “You remind me of everything that followed.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>She has saved her dead parents’ letters on the top shelf of her closet, in a large white purse she used to carry in the seventies until the strap broke. Once a year she dumps the letters onto her bed and goes through them, devoting an entire day to her parents’ words, allowing herself a good cry. She revisits their affection and concern, conveyed weekly, faithfully, across continents—all the bits of news that had had nothing to do with her life in Cambridge but which had sustained her in those days nevertheless.</p>
