<h1 class="title">The Namesake</h1>

<p>Picking up <strong>The Namesake</strong> had been a long time coming since I loved the short stories by <strong>Jhumpa Lahiri</strong> in her first book. Having been an immigrant in the US with a family myself, this book truly got its hooks into me with its story of a similar Bengali immigrant family on the East Coast 50 years ago. Having experienced the birth of our child, isolated from family in the midst of COVID, the birth of our protagonist Gogol at the start of the story resonated deeply with me. Ashima is a young Bengali woman has an arranged marriage in the 1960s to Ashoke, a PhD, and moves with him to the US. Tracing familiar paths taken by such legal immigrants, we see them have children (Gogol and Sonia)</p>
<p>The author Gogol and the short story The Overcoat.</p>
<p>The naming of the child, escaping the shackles of his name, relationships, Though the book centers around Gogol, to me the real protagonist was Ashima. Suffering the loneliness of married to a man she barely knew, living a whole new life in a cold foreign land, experiencing delivery without her family nearby, discovering the freedom of creating her own life.</p>
<p>This was easily the best book I read this year and probably one of the best I have ever read. Having been a legal immigrant for more than 15 years, I have lived the experiences that Jhumpa so vividly captured in these pages. This is probably the quintessential book of the life of legal immigrants from South Asia in the US. I truly doubt any book can surpass what Jhumpa has achieved here.</p>
