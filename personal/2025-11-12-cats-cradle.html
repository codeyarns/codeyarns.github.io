<p>I got a second taste this year of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Vonnegut"><strong>Kurt
Vonnegut’s</strong></a> dark humor with <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat%27s_Cradle"><strong>Cat’s
Cradle</strong></a>. The story is narrated by Jonah, a writer who is
interested in the life of the now-deceased scientist <em>Felix
Hoenikker</em>, who apparently gave the world the atom bomb and has also
bequethed his 3 children <em>Ice-Nine</em> which can freeze all water
that it touches. We learn that Felix was a recluse and unempathetic
person and meet his 3 children: Angela, Newton and Frank. The narrator
ends up taking a plane ride to the Carribean island nation of San
Lorenzo, where Frank has become the 2nd in line to the island’s aging
dictator <em>General Papa Lorenzo</em>. A series of crazy events on that
dirt-poor island lead to Jonah becoming the next leader and ends up
freezing the entire world over!</p>
<p>The entire book is written as small chapters of a page each, so
reading it feels fast and easy. Most of the characters in this story are
influenced by a religion named <em>Bokononism</em> and its crazy edicts
and practices pervade and entertain. The plot is a dark sarcastic look
at dictatorships, American neo-colonialism, capitalism, religions and
cults, and the inhumaness of scientific progress. It is written in a
style that is truly unique to Vonnegut and much like his <a
href="2025-01-18-player-piano.html"><strong>Player Piano</strong></a> is
very unpredictable and enjoyable.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/5</p>

<h2 id="excerpts">Excerpts</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The first sentence in The Books of Bokonon is this: “All of the true
things I am about to tell you are shameless lies.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Sometimes I think that’s the trouble with the world: too many people
in high places who are stone-cold dead.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Back in Chicago, we don’t make bicycles any more. It’s all human
relations now. The eggheads sit around trying to figure out new ways for
everybody to be happy. Nobody can get fired, no matter what; and if
somebody does accidentally make a bicycle, the union accuses us of cruel
and inhuman practices and the government confiscates the bicycle for
back taxes and gives it to a blind man in Afghanistan.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The major point at which his reason and his sense of humor left him
was when he approached the question of what people were really supposed
to do with their time on Earth. He believed firmly that they were meant
to build bicycles for him.</p>
