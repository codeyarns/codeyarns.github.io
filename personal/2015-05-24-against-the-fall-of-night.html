<p><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Against_the_Fall_of_Night"><strong>Against
the Fall of Night</strong></a> is the most boringly titled, but
refreshing, first novel of <strong>Arthur C. Clarke</strong>. Many
millions of centuries of human history have passed, Earth is covered
with deserts and a lone city remains named <strong>Diaspar</strong>.
Technology and robotics have far exceeded imagination, humans are
virtually immortal, but surprisingly they are meek and have no desire to
explore new planets or Suns. <strong>Alvin</strong>, the youngest human
born of Diaspar starts to get inquisitive about what lies outside the
city. With the help of the <strong>Keeper of Records</strong> he goes on
to discover relics of a thriving human past and how they came to be
relegated to this miserable existence.</p>
<p>Originally written in 1948, this novella remains surprisingly
imaginative and readable today. Despite its short length, the story
touches upon a lot of interesting aspects: race, history, robots,
computers, extra terrestrial intelligence and space exploration. Using a
young Alvin as a plucky implacable explorer, the story is simply a lot
of fun as seen from his eyes. I was constantly reminded of the original
<strong>Star Wars</strong> movie and young Skywalker. Much like that
movie, there are some entertaining instances of robot-human
interactions. Against the Fall of Night is a short and lively
page-turner.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/4</p>

<p><strong>Excerpt:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The trouble is,” said Rorden, “that there are no longer any
engineers left in the world.”</p>
<p>Alvin looked puzzled: although contact with the Keeper of the Records
had greatly enlarged his vocabulary, there were thousands of archaic
words he did not understand.</p>
<p>“An engineer,” explained Rorden, “was a man who designed and built
machines. It’s impossible for us to imagine an age without robots—but
every machine in the world had to be invented at one time or other, and
until the Master Robots were built they needed men to look after them.
Once the machines could care for themselves, human engineers were no
longer required. I think that’s a fairly accurate account, though of
course it’s mostly guesswork. Every machine we possess existed at the
beginning of our history, and many had disappeared long before it
started.”</p>
<p>“Such as flyers and spaceships,” interjected Alvin.</p>
“Yes,” agreed Rorden, “as well as the great communicators that could
reach the stars. All these things vanished when they were no longer
needed.”
