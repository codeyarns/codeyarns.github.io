<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 4/4 (A delicious followup to <strong>Manga!
Manga!</strong> and a must read for Manga fans)</p>
<p>Well entertained and educated by <a
href="2010-04-18-manga-manga-the-world-of-japanese-comics.html"><strong>Manga!
Manga! The World of Japanese Comics</strong></a>, I picked up <a
href="http://www.jai2.com/DL.htm"><strong>Dreamland Japan: Writings on
Modern Manga</strong></a>, the 1996 sequel to that book. Written by
<strong>Frederick L. Schodt</strong>, this book gives a much needed
update to the earlier book which was published way back in 1983.
<strong>Dreamland Japan</strong> is not as organized as the earlier
book, and is a loosely arranged set of essays on Manga. The first 2
parts of the book give a brief introduction to the world of Manga,
essential for the reader who has not read <strong>Manga!
Manga!</strong>. An interesting addition here is an essay on <strong><a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C5%8Djinshi">Dōjinshi</a></strong>,
the Manga artwork produced by fans. These copy the characters from
actual Manga and put them in scenarios that the creators could not think
of. This amateur market is wildly popular with large exhibitions
dedicated to them. Manga creators and publishers allow this huge grey
market to live and thrive, this is something that cannot be imagined in
copyright-crazed USA!</p>
<p>Part 3 is a huge section that looks at the various genres of Manga
magazines by describing a few popular titles from each. Kids are hooked
to <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CoroCoro_Comic"><strong>CoroCoro
Comic</strong></a>, which publishes the mega-hit
<strong>Doraemon</strong>. Young boys read <strong><a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weekly_Sh%C5%8Dnen_Jump">Weekly
Shonen Jump</a></strong>, the most popular Manga magazine which
sometimes has a readership of 6 million per week! Japanese are addicts
to gambling games like <strong><a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahjong">Mahjong</a></strong> and
<strong><a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pachinko">Pachinko</a></strong> and
magazines aimed at them are popular too. Finally, magazines like <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_%28manga_magazine%29"><strong>June</strong></a>
and <strong>Comic Amour</strong> provide the erotic fare that Manga is
(in)famous for.</p>
<p>In part 4, Schodt introduces his favorite Manga artists and editors,
their style, history and works. Oddly, a lot of his choice seem to be
purveyors of gore or sex! The artists who stands out here are <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fujiko_Fujio"><strong>Fujiko
Fujio</strong></a>, the creator duo behind <strong><a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doraemon">Doraemon</a></strong>, the
all-time smash-hit Manga about a robot cat. By 1996 itself, Doraemon
books had sold a stupendous 108 million copies! Another interesting
essay here shows just how much freedom Manga magazines have in Japan.
This is about <strong>Aum Comics</strong>, published by the notorious <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aum_Shinrikyo"><strong>Aum
cult</strong></a>, which was behind the deadly <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarin_gas_attack_on_the_Tokyo_subway">sarin
gas attacks</a> in 1995.</p>

<p>The entire of part 5 is dedicated to just one person, <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osamu_Tezuka"><strong>Osamu
Tezuka</strong></a>, the <em>God of Manga</em> himself! The author knew
Osamu well, having acted as his manager and translator on his visits to
USA. Sadly, Osamu passed away in 1989 at the age of 60. Osamu is
frequently compared to Walt Disney, but Tezuka is more an artist and
less a businessman. Over his lifetime, Osamu firmly shaped the world of
Manga with 150,000 pages of artwork spread over 500 titles. Most notable
among his works are <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astro_Boy"><strong>Astro
Boy</strong></a>, <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_%28manga%29"><strong>Adolf</strong></a>,
<strong><a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Jack_%28manga%29">Black
Jack</a></strong>, <strong><a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddha_%28manga%29">Buddha</a></strong>
and <strong>Phoenix</strong>. Phoenix deals with the search for
immortality and reincarnation and was called by Osamu as his <em>raifu
waaku</em> (life’s work). Tezuka was also the creator of <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimba_the_White_Lion"><strong>Jungle
Emperor</strong></a>, whose artwork Disney shamelessly stole for their
<strong>Lion King</strong> franchise without ever crediting him.</p>
<p>The last part of the book looks at where Manga is headed in the
future. The author was optimistic about the English market (USA) and the
Internet. Both of his predictions have become true in the decade since.
Manga is all over the Internet, with countless fans involved in <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanlation">scanlating</a> and
sharing them. Comparatively, growth in Manga USA had a tough time, but
has now caught on with <a
href="http://www.darkhorse.com/Zones/Manga">regular publications</a>
coming from publishers like <strong>Dark Horse Comics</strong>. Though
Manga sales have started to decline in Japan (how many decades can they
rise?), it has now gained a strong foothold across East Asia and is
spreading across USA and other English markets.</p>
<p>Well researched and written, filled with artwork and personal
anecdotes, <strong>Dreamland Japan: Writings on Modern Manga</strong> is
a delicious followup to <strong>Manga! Manga!</strong>. I highly
recommend both books for anyone interested to discover the world of
Manga.</p>
