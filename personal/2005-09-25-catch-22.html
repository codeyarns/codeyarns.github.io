<p>Take a sane US Air Force bombardier named <em>Yossarian</em> and put
him in the middle of World War II at a tiny island base called
<em>Pianosa</em> in Italy. Surround him with people who are almost
insane and trash up his life with inane bureaucratic hurdles. What you
get is <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catch-22"><strong>Catch-22</strong></a>
by Joseph Heller, a book which is both maddening and brilliant. This is
a book which I cannot even describe because there are no words for it.
It is a comical insane trip for the mind, at the same time being thought
fodder on the current state of the world.</p>
<p>Catch-22 was not an easy read. I almost gave up after the first 100
pages or so, not being able to see where the story was going. In fact,
what I had to really do was to just keep reading and to let the extreme
sarcasm and insanity of the book to sink in. The book is too long for
its subject and the circular logic of Catch-22 in the dialogues are just
too many and I felt that it spoils the reading. The last few chapters
(starting with <em>The Eternal City</em>) get pretty serious and
culminates in a happy ending for poor Yossarian. An escape for him from
the asylum.</p>
<p>In case you were wondering what is Catch-22, it a military rule, the
circular logic of which most notably prevents anyone from avoiding
combat missions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One may only be excused from flying bombing missions on the grounds
of insanity; One must assert one’s insanity to be excused on this basis;
One who requests to be excused is presumably in fear for his life. This
is taken to be proof of his sanity, and he is therefore obliged to
continue flying missions; One who is truly insane presumably would not
make the request. He therefore would continue flying missions, even
though as an insane person he could of course be excused from them
simply by asking.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 3/4 (Stretched, but hilarious)</p>
