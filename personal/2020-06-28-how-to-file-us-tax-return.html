<h1 class="title">How to file US tax return</h1>

<p>This is the information I found useful when filing US tax returns as a <strong>resident alien on a work visa</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Both federal and state tax returns have to be filed.</li>
<li>The tax year is from 1-Jan to 31-Dec. For example, the 2019 tax year is from 1-Jan-2019 to 31-Dec-2019 and you file tax for it in 2020 before 30-Apr-2020.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="tools-to-file">Tools to file</h2>
<p>The popular choices seem to be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Turbo Tax: This online is the most popular choice. I found it to be the easiest to use, since it has lots of help to guide you during the process. However, you cannot use it if your spouse or child does not have an ITIN number.</li>
<li>Tax Preparer: Humans who can file taxes for you. I had to use a tax preparer my first year since they turned out to be the easiest option to file ITIN application for my spouse and child. I was also surprised to find that their fees were comparable to Turbo Tax fees. The prepaper I used was <a href="https://diwakartaxes.com/"><strong>Diwakar Taxes</strong></a>. You should probably choose someone located close to you, since you need to drop by their office.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other choices seem to be:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.creditkarma.com/tax">CreditKarma Tax</a>: A free Online service. It is not as friendly as Turbo Tax.</li>
<li><a href="https://sites.google.com/site/excel1040/">1040 Excel spreadsheet tax calculator</a>: For folks who want to enter the tax return themselves.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="interest">Interest</h2>
<p>Use the form 1099-INT provided by your checking bank account, savings bank account and the cash accounts in your brokerage firm or your mutual fund firm.</p>
<p>Note there will be a separate entry or form for each account, even if the firm might send a single consolidated form to you.</p>
<h2 id="dividends">Dividends</h2>
<p>Use the form 1099-DIV provided by your brokerage firm or your mutual fund firm.</p>
<h2 id="foreign-bank-accounts">Foreign bank accounts</h2>
<p>If there are foreign bank accounts in your name, you need to report:</p>
<ul>
<li>Form 1099-OID: To indicate you have foreign bank accounts. If you do not have deposits that are higher than a certain big amount (in 2019 tax year this was $100,000), you just need to indicate that.</li>
<li>Form 1099-INT (see above): For the interest earned in these bank accounts during the tax year. My Indian banks do not issue 1099-INT, though my accounts are NRE. So I had to enter the interest amount in USD by converting them using the <a href="https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/yearly-average-currency-exchange-rates">IRS currency exchange rate</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>More info <a href="https://ttlc.intuit.com/community/tax-credits-deductions/discussion/yes-if-you-are-filing-a-resident-tax-return-form-1040/01/596635/highlight/true#M77868">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="rsu-and-espp-sales">RSU and ESPP sales</h2>
<p>If you sold any of the RSU or ESPP shares you got from your company during the tax year, you will need to declare that. I found that I needed these documents from my brokerage firm (Charles Schwab): <strong>1099-B</strong> and the <strong>year-end statement</strong>.</p>
<p>Turbo Tax has separate sections for RSU and ESPP. I had to enter each of the sales listed in 1099-B (X shares of Y) individually in Turbo Tax. You will need to choose if the sale was short-term or long-term and if the basis was reported to IRS or not: this is mentioned above the listing of sales in 1099-B. For my case, ESPP basis was reported, but RSU basis was not reported. The other details needed are the acquired and sold dates (Box 1b and 1c), <strong>proceeds</strong> (Box 1d) and the <strong>cost basis</strong> (Box 1e) for each sale. For ESPP, you might need to also additionally enter the <strong>adjusted cost basis</strong>, which I found listed in the year-end statement.</p>
<h2 id="self-income">Self income</h2>
<p>Small incomes from selling stuff or online ad revenue can be reported in Turbo Tax as independent income.</p>
