<p>I picked up <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Flying-Blind-Tragedy-Fall-Boeing/dp/0385546491"><strong>Flying
Blind</strong></a> after <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Cantrill">Bryan Cantrill</a>

how this book on the Boeing 737 MAX fiasco was a cautionary tale on
decay of culture/values in engineering companies. Boeing used to be one
of the <em>great American companies</em>. Formed more than a century
ago, their plane business took off in the golden era of air travel and
they ended up being one of the duopoly, with Airbus, on domestic and
international planes. Boeing had a great engineering-driven and
safety-driven culture at their Seatlle HQ and slowly won the market with
the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Commercial_Airplanes"><strong>7x7
series</strong></a> of airplanes. The pinnacle of their excellence would
be the 747 Jumbo Jet and 777.</p>
<p>When a spate of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas_DC-10"><strong>DC-10</strong></a>
accidents sounded the death knell for their domestic rival <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas"><strong>McDonnell
Douglas</strong></a>, Boeing decided to acquire MDD to grab its defense
business. This fateful decision would lead to MDD’s predatory managers
and a slew of Jack Welch’s minions from GE to take over the upper
management of Boeing. They used stack-and-yank to fire senior engineers,
killed worker unions, moved manufacturing to other states,
outsourced/sold/killed every non-essential department and even moved the
HQ to Chicago. Even more worryingly, Boeing lobbied and killed the
independence of the FAA, in essence becoming
<em>self-regulating</em>.</p>
<p>When faced with new airplane designs from Airbus, the now-rotten
Boeing management killed expensive-but-novel clean-sheet designs and
instead focused on creating derivatives of older 7xx designs, resulting
in the 787 Dreamliner and 737 MAX. An early indication of this corporate
decay were the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Boeing_787_Dreamliner_grounding">battery
fires</a> which grounded Dreamliners. This had been a scenario that
engineers had shared with management during design, but had been
ignored.</p>
<p>The epitome of bad decisions would be the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_MAX"><strong>737
MAX</strong></a>. To compete with the modern <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A320neo_family"><strong>Airbus
A320neo</strong></a>, Boeing updated the dinosaur 737 with more powerful
and efficient engines. The placement of these heavier engines surfaced a
fundamental flaw - during ascent the nose could point up. Boeing decided
to workaround this in software - using <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maneuvering_Characteristics_Augmentation_System"><strong>MCAS</strong></a>
to read the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle_of_attack">angle-of-attack
(AoA)</a> sensors and force the nose down. To get around FAA approval
delays and to avoid costly-simulator retraining for 737-certified
pilots, Boeing hid MCAS from regulators, airlines and pilots. In what I
think is the dirtiest business trick ever, cockpit AoA indicators were
made optional extras (taken out of the base model to make it
price-competitive against A320neo) and this cheaper model was what
airlines in Asia and Africa unknowingly purchased.</p>
<p>What could result from this series of mistakes but a loss of life?
Pilots on a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion_Air_Flight_610">2018 Lion Air
flight</a> with a faulty AoA sensor could not control the plane when
MCAS repeatedly kept pushing the plane down to its demise. Boeing and
FAA concluded this as pilot error, but already alarm bells will ringing
among US pilots who were only now learning about MCAS. A few months
later a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopian_Airlines_Flight_302">2019
Ethiopian Airlines flight</a> killed all its fliers in a similar pattern
and only then did FAA finally ground the planes. Since the people who
died were <em>those people</em> (meaning not rich nations) the insurance
folks, lawyers and Boeing tried horrible tricks on the families of the
deceased to get away with the least compensation. And Boeing finally
announced more fixes in software (that would take months) and FAA
announced simulator training for MAX pilots (which they should have done
in the first place).</p>
<p>The author <strong>Peter Robison</strong> is an investigative
journalist for business papers and he covers the covers the history of
Boeing, organizational changes, the accidents and the aftermath well.
The book is way more detailed than it needs to be though on the
management front - I did not see the point in knowing details of the
hundreds of upper management folks in Boeing/MDD/GE. And the book is
severely lacking in details of engineering culture, plane
hardware/software design, MCAS or the sensors and photos and diagrams.
Though the CEO would lose his job in the aftermath and people forgot
about MAX with the COVID pandemic, the author notes that nothing really
has changed in the Boeing culture even today. It is sad to read the slow
demise of a good technology company and this book definitely makes me
scared of ever flying in a 737 MAX.</p>
