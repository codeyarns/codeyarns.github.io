<p>These are my experiences getting a driver license and renewing it in the US as a work visa holder.</p>
<h2 id="driver-license">Driver license</h2>
<p>A long story for some other day.</p>
<h2 id="driver-license-renewal">Driver license renewal</h2>
<p>Described below is my experience renewing my driver license after my <strong>H-1B renewal</strong>. Note that I had not yet gone to India to get a visa stamp in my passport.</p>
<ul>
<li>The DMV where I got my driver license sent me a renewal application by mail a couple of months before my license was to expire.</li>
<li>The mail recommended doing the renewal online - but my attempt to do that at the <a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/"><strong>California DMV</strong></a> website did not go through.</li>
<li>I was thinking about mailing back the filled out application with a check. But other folks dissuaded me that this does not work for work visa holders. I needed to go to the DMV in person to renew. They were right about this.</li>
<li>I decided to go the <a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/field-office/san-jose-driver-license-processing-center-dl-only/"><strong>San Jose Driver License Processing Center (DLPC)</strong></a>, instead of a regular DMV, since they specialize in licenses. I did not take any appointment, but did a walk-in.</li>
<li>The person at the entrance asked whether I had filled out an online application to get an <strong>electronic confirmation number</strong>. I had no idea what she was talking about. She asked me to use one of the computers used for the knowledge test to fill out the online application. I got a confirmation number she wanted after that and got a queue number from her.</li>
<li>When my queue number was called, the person asked for my current license, passport and I-797A. I noticed that she used the I-94 at the bottom of the I-797A for her application. These documents, plus a fingerprint scan and after taking a photo, I had a <strong>temporary driver license</strong> valid for 2 months.</li>
<li>The actual driver license would come by mail.</li>
</ul>
<p>My spouse though, who is a H4 dependent, could not renew her license. This is because, after a H-1B renewal the DMV requires either a visa stamp in the H4 holder's passport or a I-94 with the new renewed dates. The immigration folks at my workplace had applied for a I-539, but we had not yet received that updated I-94 for her.</p>
