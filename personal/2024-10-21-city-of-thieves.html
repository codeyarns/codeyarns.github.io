<p>I thought that the author’s name seemed oddly familiar when I picked
up <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Thieves_(novel)"><strong>City
of Thieves</strong></a>. And indeed my memory served right, since the
name of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Benioff"><strong>David
Benioff</strong></a> is emblazoned at the end of every single <em>Game
of Thrones</em> title sequence as its executive producer and
creator.</p>
<p>This is a story narrated by a Russian Jewish teenager named
<em>Lev</em>, trying to survive alone under the brutal <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Leningrad"><em>Seige of
Leningrad</em></a> during WW2. He is caught by Russian soldiers while
stealing a German knife from a downed Nazi pilot’s body. In the jail, he
meets an older soldier named <em>Kolya</em> and both are expecting to be
executed in the morning. Surprisingly, the general lets them go under
the condition that they return with a dozen eggs for his daughter’s
wedding cake in a week.</p>
<p>This turns out to be a mission as good as being dead since there is
virtually no food left in the city due to the seige and the situation is
so dire that they miraculously escape from the clutches of cannibals!
The fast-talking smart-ass Kolya convinces young Lev that their best
chance is to sneak out of the city and visit one of the Russian villages
that are under Nazi occupation. After some hair raising adventures out
in the cold, they arrive at a pleasure home used daily by the local Nazi
brute <em>Abendroth</em> and his minions. While trying to save the
Russian women there, they run into a Russian rebel sniper Vika and her
compatriots. They are chased and caught by Abendroth and are almost
facing execution. The smooth talking Kolya convinces Abendroth to a
chess game with Lev and Vika and the trio plan a ludicrous plot to kill
him and get the eggs.</p>
<p>This is a very dark comedy, <em>“<a
href="2005-09-25-catch-22.html">Catch-22</a> meets <a
href="2005-10-02-heart-of-darkness.html">Heart of Darkness</a>”</em>, as
one of my friends described it. The three main characters are very
memorable and you root for their escape in every page. While Lev is
careful and innocent, Kolya brings the big-brother yang with his wise
cracks, apparent experience with the ladies and drops verses from his
unpublished book <em>The Courtyard Hound</em>. Since I have read some
Russian classics, it clearly felt here like an American writing from the
point of view of a Russian, which is the only minor quibble I have with
this book. The details of the seige and the incredible amount of
suffering, famine and death are all apparently true and based on
information from the book <em>The 900 Days</em>. This novel is a riot to
read, from the opening to the end, it is fast, nerve wracking, full of
surprises and genuinely great moments. Much like GoT, one might say!</p>
<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 4/5</p>
