<p>Dear Mr. Nagathahalli Chandrashekhar,</p>
<p>Are you really the guy who made the movie America America? In a movie where you could have just wowed audiences with scenes from USA, you went ahead and actually gave us an intellectual memorable journey which resonates with me even to this day. Madhu, Priyank () and me decided to catch your latest movie Amrithadaare at INOX today. At the worst we expected a decent movie.</p>
<p>Sure we can see that the heroine Ramya is cuter than a baby and that Dhyan will break a lot of female hearts. We know that the songs of this movie are just fabulous, I still have them on my playlist. But, you can't just thrown in nice looking people, good songs and not deliver on the execution and expect a good movie, did you?</p>
<p>Sadly, thats what Amrithadaare is! There isn't even a semblance of a continuous story here. The couple's love story isn't believable. The effort they put into the home they build isn't. And lastly we can't believe even when you try to pull at our heartstrings by drowning the couple in tragedy. Even a guest appearance by the Big B can't save this movie. Sorry! Hope to see a better movie from you next time.</p>
<p>Bye.</p>
