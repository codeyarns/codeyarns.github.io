<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 2/4 (Disappointing, especially coming from
Spielberg)</p>
<p>Starring Tom Cruise and Dakota Fanning, <em><a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_Worlds_%282005_film%29">War
of the Worlds</a></em> is loosely based on the novel of the same name by
H. G. Wells. Tom Cruise plays Ray, a crane operator who is left in
charge of his daughter Rachel (Dakota) and his teenage son for a weekend
by his long estranged wife. Strange things start happening near his
place that weekend. Earth is struck my EMPs and there is lots of
lightning. Huge <em>tripods</em> break out of the earth and start
destroying people with their heat rays. We learn that they are aliens
who are now terminating humans.</p>
<p>With the screaming Rachel calling on his attention every minute, Ray
takes charge and drives her and his son over to Boston. On the way they
stopover at his wife’s place which is now empty. They spend a terror
filled night only to be greeted by more destruction by the tripods. A
747 has crashed in their frontyard. The destruction of the tripods and
Ray running away from them continues on and on forever. During this
time, we learn that the aliens are using the blood of humans to spread
their <em>red weed</em>! In the end, all bodes well and the aliens go
weak and die. They are killed by microorganisms, the same germs for
which we have gained immunity in the process of evolution over millions
of years.</p>
<p>I guess Spielberg did not have much freedom with an old novel like
this and also since it has been adapted so many times on TV and radio.
He seems to be evoking feelings of 9/11 in this movie by putting Ray
into save-the-family situations. Spielberg shines in these family and
emotions department, but other than that this movie is disappointing.
Barely worth a watch for Spielberg fans.</p>
