<p>Many years after enjoying <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov"><strong>Isaac
Asimov</strong></a>’s <a href="2015-08-23-i-robot.html"><strong>I,
Robot</strong></a> short story collection, I returned to read <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Complete_Robot"><strong>The
Complete Robot</strong></a>, which brings together all of his Robot
stories under a single cover. There are 31 stories here, originally
published from 1939 to 1977, sourced from magazines and short story
collections. The stories are not ordered chronologically, but split into
categories created by Asimov himself for this book.</p>
<p>The Non-human Robots category was one of my favorites with clever and
heart warming stories. The robots here are not humanoid and so are not
bound by the Three Laws of Robotics, making the plots easier. Stories in
the The Immobile Robots category are what could be termed as Asimov’s
vision of the intelligent computers of the future (aka our computers of
today). Some Metallic Robots feature stories of industrial or servant
robots typically used on other planets. Robbie is a standout here,
Asimov’s first Robot story and is quite a heart tugging one involving
children.</p>
<p>In the Some Humanoid Robots, we finally get to situations where the
<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Laws_of_Robotics"><strong>Three
Laws of Robotics</strong></a> (which are programmed into these robots)
are stress tested in various intriguing situations. There are mysteries
to be solved, puzzles to be unraveled and the bounds of human-robot
harmony to be tested. A separate category features clever conundrums
into which the funny duo of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Robot_series_characters#Powell_and_Donovan"><strong>Powell
and Donovan</strong></a> are thrust into, usually involving a
misbehaving robot. <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Calvin"><strong>Susan
Calvin</strong></a>, the famous robopsychologist of Asimov’s stories and
his most popular human character gets her own category. Dealing with
complex interplays of humans and robots, these stories are the most
mature and examine deep into what robots might think or dream. Two long
stories end the book, with <strong>The Bicentennial Man</strong> setting
up a final destiny for robots: a wish to be human.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, this ~700 page omnibus provided many moments of
thought provoking and fun reading. Since it was easy to put away after
finishing a story, the book was slow to finish though. Published in
1982, it has a beautiful introduction by Asimov explaining how he got
started into robot stories, how the robots evolved over the decades of
his writing and the state of robotics at the time of this publication.
Though undoubtedly visionary, the reader of today will notice something
missing in all of these stories - the internet. If you can get past that
and accept that somehow a positronic brain was created and programmed,
these stories pretty much envision every possible scenario involving
humans and robots. All these reasons and many more make this collection
<em>the</em> definitive vehicle to get into Asimov’s Robot stories.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/4</p>
