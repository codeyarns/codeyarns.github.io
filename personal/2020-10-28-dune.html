<p>The novel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_(novel)"><strong>Dune</strong></a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Herbert"><strong>Frank Herbert</strong></a> had been appearing in discussions with my friends several times in the near past. I ended up watching the <strong>Jodorowski's Dune</strong> documentary which was insane-and-fantastic. But the announcement of a new Dune movie by Denis Villeneuve and the selection of the book for my bookclub finally forced me to read and finish this classic.</p>
<p>Dune is widely regarded as the most popular science fiction book of all time! I found it to be a <em>fantasy</em> rather than a sci-fi work, more like LOTR. The book introduces us to the desert planet of <strong>Arrakis</strong>, which has <em>melange spice</em>, the most precious commodity in the entire world. The Emperor Shaddam IV replaces the villainous Harkonnens on Arrakis with the House Atreides. Despite taking all possible precautions, the Duke Leto Atreides is assassinated and his concubine Lady Jessica and his son Paul are forced to hide in the desert among the mysterious native Fremen people. Paul and his mother end up fulfilling a long-held prophecy among the Fremen, becoming their leader and Reverend Mother respectively. Paul leads the Fremen to battle against the Harkonnens and eventually against the Emperor, defeating both and ends up as the Emperor of this fantasy world.</p>
<p>Fantasy is not my genre, I have tried reading LOTR and GOT and given up easily. But somehow the depth of story telling, the incredible characters and the inhospitable Arrakis, all were so compelling in Dune that I relished reading it. There was a strong GoT Season 1 vibes in the novel with a much beloved Duke Leto, like Ned Stark, moving to take on new responsibilities (becoming the King's Hand) and ends up losing his life to the shock of the reader. And his wife and children end up being fugitives, vowing to return and take the throne. The first part of the book has some incredibly emotional moments with the child-to-man transformation of Paul and the interesting assassination plot.</p>
<p>How the Fremen manage to survive and thrive in the desert, coexisting with monstrous sandworms, dominates part 2 of the book. Herbert borrows heavily from Bedouin culture, Islamic religion, Arabic and Persian words to fashion the Fremen. I especially loved how water is the most precious commodity for them - so much so that they capture every bit of moisture expelled from their body by wearing <em>stillsuits</em> and how they <em>retake</em> the water from any person who dies! Ecology is probably the biggest underlying theme of the book. Both the planetologist Kynes and the Fremen are involved in a centuries-long effort to squeeze out water in the desert and start a green revolution that will eventually make their lives easier.</p>
<p>It is easy to see why this book spawned an entire series of sequels and prequels. In just this first book, Herbert creates a vast universe of inhabited planets and space travel controlled by a mysterious <em>Guild</em>. The Imperial Emperor rules with an iron fist using his dreaded army of ferocious <em>Sardaukar</em> soldiers. Under him are the various Houses, which are in a power struggle amongst themselves. And there is a mysterious sisterhood of witches called the Bene Gesserit (and their propaganda arm Missionaria Protectiva) and human computers called Mentat. There are various space faring technologies, defense technologies like the <em>shield</em> and <em>lasguns</em> and transportation like <em>thopters</em>. This is an incredibly rich world, full of exciting new things, setting the stage that is ripe for many stories. The book introduces a ton of new jargon, for which the dictionary in the appendix at the end of the book is useful.</p>
<p>So I ended up loving Dune. Much like reading a Dickens classic, the reading became a <em>journey</em>. I might even read a couple more from the Dune series, just to cash in on the investment I made in the first one. If you have been on the fence, I would highly recommend reading Dune, there is quite simply no book like this one.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/4</p>
