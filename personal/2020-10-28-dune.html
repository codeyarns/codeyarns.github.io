<p>The novel <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_(novel)"><strong>Dune</strong></a>
by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Herbert"><strong>Frank
Herbert</strong></a> had been appearing in discussions with my friends
several times in the near past. I ended up watching the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jodorowsky%27s_Dune"><strong>Jodorowski’s
Dune</strong></a> documentary which was insane-and-fantastic. But the
announcement of a new Dune movie by Denis Villeneuve and the selection
of the book for my book club finally forced me to read and finish this
classic.</p>
<p>Dune is widely regarded as the most popular science fiction book of
all time! I found it to be a <em>fantasy</em> rather than a sci-fi work,
more like LOTR. The book introduces us to the desert planet of
<strong>Arrakis</strong>, which has <em>melange spice</em>, the most
precious commodity in the entire world. The Emperor Shaddam IV replaces
the villainous Harkonnens on Arrakis with the House Atreides. Despite
taking all possible precautions, the Duke Leto Atreides is assassinated
and his concubine Lady Jessica and his son Paul are forced to hide in
the desert among the mysterious native Fremen people. Paul and his
mother end up fulfilling a long-held prophecy among the Fremen, becoming
their leader and Reverend Mother respectively. Paul leads the Fremen to
battle against the Harkonnens and eventually against the Emperor,
defeating both and ends up as the Emperor of this fantasy world.</p>
<p>Fantasy is not my genre, I have tried reading LOTR and GOT and given
up easily. But somehow the depth of story telling, the incredible
characters and the inhospitable Arrakis, all were so compelling in Dune
that I relished reading it. There was a strong GoT Season 1 vibes in the
novel with a much beloved Duke Leto, like Ned Stark, moving to take on
new responsibilities (becoming the King’s Hand) and ends up losing his
life to the shock of the reader. And his wife and children end up being
fugitives, vowing to return and take the throne. The first part of the
book has some incredibly emotional moments with the child-to-man
transformation of Paul and the interesting assassination plot.</p>
<p>How the Fremen manage to survive and thrive in the desert, coexisting
with monstrous sandworms, dominates part 2 of the book. Herbert borrows
heavily from Bedouin culture, Islamic religion, Arabic and Persian words
to fashion the Fremen. I especially loved how water is the most precious
commodity for them - so much so that they capture every bit of moisture
expelled from their body by wearing <em>stillsuits</em> and how they
<em>retake</em> the water from any person who dies! Ecology is probably
the biggest underlying theme of the book. Both the planetologist Kynes
and the Fremen are involved in a centuries-long effort to squeeze out
water in the desert and start a green revolution that will eventually
make their lives easier.</p>
<p>It is easy to see why this book spawned an entire series of sequels
and prequels. In just this first book, Herbert creates a vast universe
of inhabited planets and space travel controlled by a mysterious
<em>Guild</em>. The Imperial Emperor rules with an iron fist using his
dreaded army of ferocious <em>Sardaukar</em> soldiers. Under him are the
various Houses, which are in a power struggle amongst themselves. And
there is a mysterious sisterhood of witches called the Bene Gesserit
(and their propaganda arm Missionaria Protectiva) and human computers
called Mentat. There are various space faring technologies, defense
technologies like the <em>shield</em> and <em>lasguns</em> and
transportation like <em>thopters</em>. This is an incredibly rich world,
full of exciting new things, setting a stage that is ripe for many
stories. The book also introduces a ton of new jargon, for which the
dictionary provided in the appendix was useful.</p>
<p>So yes, I absolutely loved Dune. At about 500 pages, this felt like
reading a Dickens classic, felt like a <em>journey</em> of many weeks.
And to cash in the investment made into the Dune universe, I might end
up reading a couple more from the series. If you have been on the fence,
I would highly recommend reading Dune, there is quite simply no book
like this one.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/4</p>
<h2 id="excerpts">Excerpts</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death
that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to
pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the
inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be
nothing. Only I will remain.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Grave this on your memory, lad: A world is supported by four things
…” She held up four big-knuckled fingers. “… the learning of the wise,
the justice of the great, the prayers of the righteous and the valor of
the brave. But all of these are as nothing …” She closed her fingers
into a fist. “… without a ruler who knows the art of ruling. Make that
the science of your tradition!”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The Duke felt in this moment that his own dearest dream was to end
all class distinctions and never again think of deadly order. He looked
up and out of the dust at the unwinking stars, thought: Around one of
those little lights circles Caladan … but I’ll never again see my home.
The longing for Caladan was a sudden pain in his breast. He felt that it
did not come from within himself, but that it reached out to him from
Caladan. He could not bring himself to call this dry wasteland of
Arrakis his home, and he doubted he ever would.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“The whole theory of warfare is calculated risk,” the Duke said, “but
when it comes to risking your own family, the element of calculation
gets submerged in … other things.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“There is no escape—we pay for the violence of our ancestors.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Halleck’s words came back to Paul: “Mood’s a thing for cattle or for
making love. You fight when the necessity arises, no matter your
mood.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>How the mind gears itself for its environment, she thought. And she
recalled a Bene Gesserit axiom: “The mind can go either direction under
stress—toward positive or toward negative: on or off. Think of it as a
spectrum whose extremes are unconsciousness at the negative end and
hyperconsciousness at the positive end. The way the mind will lean under
stress is strongly influenced by training.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The Fremen were supreme in that quality the ancients called
“spannungsbogen” — which is the self-imposed delay between desire for a
thing and the act of reaching out to grasp that thing.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>She permitted herself to face fully the significance of this other
child growing within her, to see her own motives in permitting the
conception. She knew what it was—she had succumbed to that profound
drive shared by all creatures who are faced with death—the drive to seek
immortality through progeny. The fertility drive of the species had
overpowered them.</p>
