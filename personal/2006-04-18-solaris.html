<p>Saw the movie <strong>Solaris</strong> last weekend. This sci-fi
movie is a remake of the <a
href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0069293/">1972 classic</a> of the same
name (I haven’t seen that version). Both are based on the sci-fi <a
href="2022-05-06-solaris.html">novel of the same name</a> written by
<strong>Stanislaw Lem</strong>. The movie is set in the future where
Kelvin (George Clooney) is a psychologist who has lost his wife he loved
very much. He is called upon to investigate some strange things
happening on a space station rotating around a star named Solaris. Once
he lands on it, he discovers that most of the crew have killed each
other or themselves. Only 2 of them are left. One of them Dr. Gordon is
trying to find the cause of the strange <em>visitors</em> on this space
station. Kelvin soon gets his own visitor — his deceased wife appears in
flesh and blood. And he falls in love with her all over again. Why/how
is Solaris creating these visitors from the memories in human minds? Who
really are these visitors?</p>
<p>Solaris is a thoughtful movie. Visually it is very similar to <a
href="2006-02-18-2001-a-space-odyssey.html">2001: A Space Odyssey</a>.
There are stretches of silence, the visuals are exquisite and the
background music is haunting at times. The movie questions human
relationships and the existence of divine beings. Strangely this topic
fits snugly into the sci-fi environment of Solaris. Remember the
interpretation-left-to-viewer ending of 2001? Something like that except
that it is easy to figure it in this movie.</p>
<p>I liked the movie. Some of the flashback scenes (in the rain,
shopping etc.) of Kelvin and his wife are very romantic and sensual
though they are set in such sterile surroundings. Clooney is simply
fabulous as the cool headed psychologist. There are nice little twists
at the end.</p>
