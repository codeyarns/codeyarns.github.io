<p>It is no secret that I love the murder mysteries by <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keigo_Higashino"><strong>Keigo
Higashino</strong></a>. <strong>Malice</strong> is the first novel in
his <strong>Police Detective Kaga</strong> series and the English
translation is by Alexander O. Smith. Set in 1996, the plot opens with
the mysterious murder of famous author <em>Hidaka</em> that is
discovered by his new second wife <em>Rie</em> and his close friend
<em>Osamu Nonoguchi</em>. As the investigation progresses, we get to
read Osamu’s journal entries and Kaga’s testimonials that lead to the
truth. There are many twists as Kaga proceeds to tear apart the initial
hypothesis and delves far into Hidaka’s childhood to solve the
murder.</p>
<p>Like in most of Higashino’s books, the murderer is found early on,
but establishing how he committed the mysterious murder is the journey.
In this book, there is also the added wrinkle of why - the motive which
dogs Kaga, why was Hidaka killed? We learn that it was due to malice,
but the details elude us until the final chapter.</p>
<p>The book is nail-biting, as always, and it took me just 2 sittings to
finish it. My mind was engrossed in the multiple possibilities and
motives until late in the night. I also liked the unique writing style
of this particular book, as either journal entries or police reports,
that really made me think harder. This is yet another perfect
un-put-downable Higashino book, the only minor quibble being a bit too
much time spent on the motive.</p>
<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 4/5</p>
<h2 id="excerpts">Excerpts</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“But your plan was unique. You had an entirely different goal in
mind. You wanted to get arrested. You didn’t care about committing the
perfect crime. You wanted to establish the perfect motive. I know. It’s
a rather startling idea. You may be the first murderer that decided to
fabricate a motive before committing the crime. Believe me, I almost
couldn’t bring myself to accept the truth. During the long hours it took
me to reach the point where I was confident I’d uncovered the truth, I
doubted myself every step of the way. In fact, I refused to believe what
the facts were telling me. Of course, had we questioned any of the
evidence earlier then we might well have resolved this much more
quickly. Yet who would suspect a killer of forging a vital piece of
evidence indicating his own guilt of a crime? Truly, that was a
brilliant stroke.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“It is an unfortunate fact that the police tend to turn a stern eye
toward evidence that benefits a suspect, but tend to be rather easygoing
when it comes to evidence that implicates our suspect. A tendency you
deftly took advantage of.”</p>
</blockquote>
