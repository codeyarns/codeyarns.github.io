<p><a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0107207/">In The Name Of The Father</a> (4/5) – The movie is based on Gerry Conlon’s autobiography Proved Innocent. Good-for-nothing teenager Gerry Conlon, his 3 friends and his entire family are (falsely) arrested for planning the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guildford_pub_bombing">Guildford pub bombing</a> (which was actually done by the IRA). The police force which is under pressure to deliver scapegoats forces the Guildford Four (Conlon and friends) to sign a confession and are sentenced to life imprisonment. In jail, the relationship between Conlon and his dad thaws and they discover they love and respect each other. After serving 15 years, Conlon’s dad dies in jail and Conlon resolves to clear his name. With the help of a lawyer, clues which weren’t shown during the hearing are discovered and the Guildford Four walk free.</p>
<p>I had wanted to see a movie about the IRA for a long time now and my friend recommended this. The movie’s great. Oscar-deserving performances by Daniel Day-Lewis and Pete Postlethwaite.</p>
