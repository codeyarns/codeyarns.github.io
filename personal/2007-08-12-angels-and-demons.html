<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angels_and_Demons">Angels And
Demons</a> (4/5) – I have to give credit to Dan Brown. Though he’ll
never win any awards for his writing, he somehow digs up the dirt on
some really cool historical events and people. His second novel mimics
his later The Da Vinci Code. Instead of Christianity, it’s the Vatican
City and the Catholic Church under fire here. There’s even an <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashshashin">Hassassin</a> who is the
mirror image of Silas. And Langdon runs around Rome finding clues from
historical works of art, mostly that of <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gian_Lorenzo_Bernini">Bernini</a>.</p>
<p>So, what happens in the novel? CERN has discovered how to create <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimatter">antimatter</a>. A capsule
of this is stolen by the Illuminati and stashed it somewhere below the
Vatican City as a time bomb. The <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illuminati">Illuminati</a> is a real
underground group that rose from the rank of scientists like Galileo
when they couldn’t stand the atrocities of the Church against science.
After hundreds of years, they’re now back for revenge. The Pope has just
died and the cardinals are gathered in the Vatican to elect the next
one. The Illuminati has captured their 4 popular candidates and will be
murdering them one an hour at some of Rome’s historical locations. It’s
up to symbologist Langdon and his CERN researcher Vittoria to stop the
murders and defuse the bomb in time.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambigram">ambigrams</a> are
a cool addition to the book. Just like in The Da Vinci Code, Langdon
will suddenly stop at critical junctures and start spouting historical
trivia. He claims all the places, incidents he presents from history are
true. Dan Brown gathered some great elements for his story, but
squanders it with amateurish writing. Not to regret too much, the book
is still an unputdownable all-nighter. A <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angels_&amp;_Demons_(film)">movie</a>
of the book is in the works with Tom Hanks as Langdon. My margin notes
are <a
