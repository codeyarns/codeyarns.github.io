<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0391304/">A Lot Like Love</a> is
supposedly a romantic movie. Emily (Amanda Peet) and Oliver (Ashton
Kutcher) meet at an airport and make out during their flight. Oliver
talks of a future where he wants to achieve some goals and then find the
girl of his dreams. Emily mocks this. So they bet on it and decide to
meet again 6 years later. Fatefully they keep running into each other
every other year as they go through several relationships and career ups
and downs. You don’t need me to tell you that 6 years later all ends
well and they find that they were meant for each other.</p>
<p>Amanda Peet is just okay but Ashton Kutcher just can’t do anything
but grin. The movie is boring and the pace is g-l-a-c-i-a-l. Don’t
watch.</p>
