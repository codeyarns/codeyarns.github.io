<p>I got around to watching <a
href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053125/">North By Northwest</a>. This
is my first Hitchcock movie (discounting Psycho, which everyone and her
shower killer should’ve seen). Cary Grant plays Roger O Thornhill, an
advertising executive who is mistaken for a government spy. He is chased
across the country by the members of a secret organization who are
afraid he might spill the beans on their plan. He is charged with murder
of an UN official and the police are looking out for him too. While
under pursuit he meets Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint), who is attracted
to him and helps him. Who are these guys who’re behind him? Where can
Thornhill go as he is relentlessly chased across the country? What’s all
this for?</p>
<p>The movie opens with a superb title sequence music which hooked me.
As in all of his movies, Hitchcock makes an early cameo appearance. The
story is intriguing, full of twists, moves very fast (reminded me of <a
href="2005-12-25-the-bourne-supremacy.html">The Bourne Supremacy</a>)
and always stays a step ahead of the viewer. Only after the credits
roll, you realize that not everything in the plot made sense. In fact,
it is full of holes. There are many iconic scenes, like the one where
Cary is chased by a crop dusting plane in the middle of nowhere. Cary
Grant, Eva Marie Saint and especially James Mason (what a voice!) have
acted well. Eva is gorgeous in this movie, frankly I was floored! The
movie is surprisingly loaded to the brim with delightful double
entendres (I didn’t know Hitchcock did this). Add to this the suspense
and the romance between Cary and Eva, and you really feel like you’re
watching a James Bond movie. In fact, I looked it up, James Bond movies
started from 1962 and this was released in 1959. I now definitely think
that this movie must’ve influenced the Bond series. This was a real
treat, I’ll definitely be watching more Hitchcock now.</p>
