<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 4/4 (Edge-of-the-seat film noir in Hindi!)</p>
<p>Thanks to the growth of multiplexes there has been a slew of small to mid budget movies coming out of Bollywood in the last few years. I find that most of them are refreshingly different from the usual SRK-song-dance crap. One example of a budget gem is <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manorama_Six_Feet_Under">Manorama Six Feet Under</a></em>. The movie is shot like a Hollywood <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_noir">film noir</a>, could be the first Hindi movie of this kind. The setting is ideal: a government engineer stuck in a small town somewhere in dusty Rajasthan. He writes pulp fiction as a side hobby! One night his creations come to life when a woman shows up at his door claiming to be a fan of his work and requests him to solve a case. He gets involved in and it pulls him into a strange whirlpool of events.</p>
<p>Full marks to the writing and script in Manorama. The suspense is great, I was on the edge wondering what would happen next right upto the end. There is excellent dark humour all through, something that I sorely miss in Hindi movies. The casting is apt, newcomer Abhay Deol plays the writer and Gul Panag plays his suspecting wife to perfection. The cinematography of empty desert places and the night scenes really suits the noir style of the movie. With not a single boring moment, <em>Manorama Six Feet Under</em> is a delightful clever gem which is sure to gain some sort of cult following with time.</p>
