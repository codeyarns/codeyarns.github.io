<p>I read <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere_(novel)"><strong>Sphere</strong></a>
a second time in 2024 and was surprised to see that I had forgotten
everything from my first read in 2006. Psychologist <em>Norman
Johnson</em> is whisked away by the Navy to the middle of the Pacific
ocean. He is taken down to an underwater habitat to join a team of
scientists and Navy people and study a crashed craft. To their surprise,
they discover that it is a huge alien spacecraft and find a perfect
black sphere inside it. While they try to unravel the mystery of the
craft and the sphere, dangerous creatures attack their habitat and start
killing them one by one.</p>
<p>As always <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Crichton"><strong>Michael
Crichton</strong></a> is super interesting to read when he sets up his
techno premise. The intriguing idea in the first act is that the craft
is actually from Earth’s future, sent to study a black hole where it
might have picked up the alien sphere and traveled back in time to our
planet. The plot plods along in the second act while they figure out how
to communicate with the alient <em>Jerry</em> entity and it starts to
send scary sea creatures to attack them. The final act has some great
twists, as we suspect whether it is the subconscious of Harry
(mathematician), Beth (zoologist) or Norman which is playing tricks on
them. In the Hollywood-like climax, the 3 survivors escape destroying
the sphere and lose their memory of the adventure.</p>
<p>Though I enjoyed it thoroughly in my first read, I found it a bit
disappointing in the second read. The craft and the sphere are
surprisingly short on any exciting technology reveals. Even the team
itself feels more artificially put together compared to the team in
Jurassic Park. The action or excitement does not build up until the
climax. There are some good science bits like Ted’s explanation of
space-time using a fruit bowl. And the final act really proves the book
to be a great psychological thriller.</p>
<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 4/5</p>
