<p>Are all the great literary works of man already written? That is what
I was left wondering after closing the final page of <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Copperfield_%28novel%29"><strong>David
Copperfield</strong></a>. This semi-autobiographical novel by <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Dickens"><strong>Charles
Dickens</strong></a> took me several failed attempts before I finally
acquired the taste for it and tore through it. It was written and
published towards the middle of his writing career in the form of 19
serial installments. It is the <em>bildungsroman</em> of the protagonist
David Copperfield, following him from birth, through his hard life
filled with colorful characters of all shades.</p>

<p>David Copperfield is born to a young widow who has no pecuniary
problems. He is brought up with love by her and his nurse Peggotty. But,
his mother remarries and Murdstone, his stepfather turns his rosy life
into hell. He is sent off to a horrible boarding school where he
befriends Steerforth, the top student. After his mother‚Äôs tragic demise,
David is removed from school and put to menial work in London. Sick of
this, he runs away to find his great aunt Betsy Trotwood, who takes him
in. She helps him finish his schooling, while he boards at the house of
Wickfield. Agnes, the daughter of Wickfield becomes his close friend.
After education he joins as an intern at a firm of proctors. David soon
falls madly in love with Dora, the daughter of his boss. Just when
David‚Äôs life is reaching its zenith of happiness, everything he has in
his life is taken away, people he knew turn evil and he is tested. David
and his good friends together emerge from all these setbacks to a happy
ending.</p>

<p>[The Penguin Popular Classics edition which I read.]</p>
<p>David Copperfield is a long, but fantastic read. Hats off to the
master of prose that is Charles Dickens. I had previously read several
of his works only as abridged editions, which I now think do <em>no</em>
justice to the originals! Dickens has an extremely close eye for detail,
with which he creates his myriad characters, places and situations. Much
like <em>The Adventures Of Oliver Twist</em>, Copperfield will be
remembered for its well etched characters who span the spectrum from
funny to honest to plain evil. It is hard to not be repulsed by a
character like Uriah Heep or not to fall in love with Agnes (who I felt
was like Betty in <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archie_Comics">Archie Comics</a>). An
adult reader is sure to relive his entire life while turning the pages
on that of David Copperfield. Written in 1849, the book plunges the
reader into a world before the advent of electricity, automobiles or
wireless media. People rely on post, travel by horse driven wagons and
ships and spend nights by candle light. It is mindblowing how vividly
Dickens is capable of pulling the reader into the world of his creation.
David Copperfield takes the reader on a journey of a lifetime!</p>
