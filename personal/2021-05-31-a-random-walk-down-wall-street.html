<p>It had been a while since reading <a
href="2019-02-24-the-bogleheads-guide-to-the-three-fund-portfolio.html"><strong>The
Bogleheads’ Guide to the Three Fund Portfolio</strong></a> and I was
ready for another book on personal investing. <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Random_Walk_Down_Wall_Street"><strong>A
Random Walk Down Wall Street</strong></a> came highly recommended and I
promptly picked it up. Written by Princeton University economics
professor <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burton_Malkiel"><strong>Burton G.
Malkiel</strong></a>, this is considered to be a classic and has had
several revisions since its first publication in 1973.</p>
<p>Divided into four parts, the first part documented the various stock
market bubbles that have happened in the US and the world. Starting from
the tulip-bulb craze (16th century) and South Sea bubble (18th century),
it details the tronics bubble and <em>synergistic</em> mergers of the
60s, the biotech bubble of the 80s, the Internet bubble and the housing
crisis of the 2000s. After reading this chapter, the current hype of
crazy P/E ratios and crypto currencies seems all too familiar.</p>
<p>Part two details how the professionals in the stock market play with
stocks. <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_analysis"><strong>Technical
analysts</strong></a> study charts of past data to derive rules and
theories to determine the appropriate time to buy or sell a stock. <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_analysis"><strong>Fundamental
analysts</strong></a> use the <em>firm foundation theory</em> to find
the true value of a stock based on the company’s finances, competitors
and markets. Malkiel shows that there are flaws in both strategies and
that neither has proven to deliver results in the long run, especially
once transaction costs and capital gains tax are taken into account.</p>
<p>Part three of the book is technical and delves into the modern
theories surrounding investment. <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory"><strong>Modern
portfolio theory (MPT)</strong></a> was developed by Nobel prize winner
Harry Markowitz in the 1950s and provides the mathematical basis for the
time-honored strategy of combining stocks for maximum returns at a given
risk. MPT would lead to the creation of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_asset_pricing_model"><strong>Capital
Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)</strong></a> in the 1960s by another bunch of
Nobel winning economists. <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_economics"><strong>Behavioral
finance</strong></a>, pioneered by Kahnemann and Tversky, studies the
influence of psychology on investor behavior. This section of the book
has some of the juiciest experiments and findings about the way humans
think and act! The author’s favorite <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis"><strong>efficient
market hypothesis</strong></a> is introduced and he argues that any
regularity or pattern that can be acted upon profitably will be
destroyed in a short time thus rendering such tricks useless to the
normal investor.</p>
<p>Part four is for you are not interested in neither the history nor
the theory and just need guidance on how to invest. Malkiel details all
the possible investment options from bank savings to bonds to stocks to
funds, explaining their pros, cons and best applicable situation to use
those instruments. The author’s suggested allocation portfolio is a mix
of index funds, REITs, bonds and savings and the details can be found in
Chapter 14. The recommendations should not be a surprise to any
Boglehead.</p>
<p>Though I picked up the 2011 edition, I found the contents of this
book to be timeless and easily applicable even amidst the overhyped
stocks and crypto craze of today. The book was an absolute delight to
read, filled with engaging historical anecdotes, great quotations,
hilarious jokes and crammed with theories and graphs that would make any
engineer drool. I also found it highly educational, covering relevant
topics in economics with user-friendly definitions of most investment
related terms. A highly recommended read.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/4</p>
