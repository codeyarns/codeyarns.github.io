<p><a href="http://tiktaalik.uchicago.edu/book.html"><strong>Your Inner
Fish</strong></a> is a fascinating new book by palaeontologist <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Shubin"><strong>Prof. Neil
Shubin</strong></a>. Using his knowledge of palaeontology and anatomy,
Shubin unravels the connections between humans and every other animal
that has ever been on this planet. The book starts off with Shubin
explaining how palaeontology works, how sites are chosen, how digs are
done and how fossils are found. Then he describes his most famous find
of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiktaalik">Tiktaalik</a>, a
fossilized fish whose fin bones reveal how it must’ve been the missing
link between fish and tetrapods. From here on the book gently turns
towards explaining how the various features of humans (brain, nerves,
eyes, ear, nose and such) have evolved from beings that lived millions
of years ago. In all chapters, he covers his bases well by using
fossils, <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_anatomy">comparative
anatomy</a>, embryology and DNA analysis for explaining.</p>
<p>Don’t get misled by the descriptions, this book is an un-put-downable
and easy read. There’s a casual demeanour in the writing, and this is
the first book which I’ve read where the author is both direct and
detailed about how certain strange artefacts in our bodies are the
results of evolution from fishes and other beings. Shubin even goes as
far back as single celled organisms to explain certain features in our
anatomy! This book definitely filled the gaps on some niggling doubts
left behind by rote textbooks, for example why/how/when did single
celled organisms come together to form multi-cellular organisms and
finally larger and complex animals? Refreshingly (for a book published
in 2008), the Creationism vs. Evolution debate is never touched! In
fact, Shubin avoids even mentioning evolution anywhere, it’s taken for
granted. This is a good read, loved it.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/4</p>
