<h1 class="title">Lassen Volcanic National Park</h1>

<p>One of the hidden gems near the Bay Area is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lassen_Volcanic_National_Park"><strong>Lassen Volcanic National Park</strong></a>. I was not even aware of this NP until someone I knew visited it. Once I checked out information about the park and realized it is just a 4.5 hour drive away, there was no hesitation in seeing it. Since we had a kid in tow, we decided to make this a relaxed 3-day vacation: one day to drive there, one day to see the NP and then drive back the third day.</p>
<h2 id="stay">Stay</h2>
<p>We decided to stay in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shingletown,_California"><strong>Shingletown</strong></a>, a sleepy town which was a short 20-min drive outside the NP. We stayed in a studio at the <a href="https://livingspringsresort.com/"><strong>Living Springs RV and Cabins Resort</strong></a>, which we booked through <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/42309473"><strong>AirBnB</strong></a> just a week before our trip. The studio had a simple cooking area, a queen bed, two bunk beds and an attached shower and toilet. Outside the studio we had a fireplace and a charcoal BBQ (which we enjoyed, so do not forget to get charcoal). The resort had RVs and cabins (without bathrooms). There is a small Mill Creek that flows behind the camping area and also a small pond which was good a calm evening walk.</p>
<h2 id="national-park">National Park</h2>
<ul>
<li>The park has two entrances: northwest and southwest. Since we were closest to the northwest entrance we drove to that. There was a $30 entrance fee we paid at the entrance.</li>
<li>There is a single 30-mile road inside the park that goes past all the trails, viewpoints and things worth seeing.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manzanita_Lake"><strong>Manzanita Lake</strong></a> is on the right when you enter and this lake was truly beautiful, with the Lassen Peak reflected in it.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loomis_Museum"><strong>Loomis Museum</strong></a> is a tiny museum and store at the north entrance. Sadly, the exhibition area was closed due to COVID.</li>
<li>There is a small <strong>Lily Pond Trail</strong> across the Loomis Museum that took us around the <strong>Reflection Lake</strong>, which had lots of bird life on the banks and in the water.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>We did not hike on the <strong>Hat Creek Trailhead</strong>, but you might still want to get out here to see the gorgeous vista of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat_Creek_(California)"><strong>Hat Creek</strong></a>, the trees and the mountain in the distance.</li>
<li>The next point on the drive we liked was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_Lake_(Reading_Peak,_Shasta_County)"><strong>Summit Lake</strong></a>. Both of its entrances were closed, but we were able to park to the side of the road and enjoy walking around it a bit. It had a picnic area, but it was closed off and there were actually deer happily wandering around it.</li>
<li>We stopped at the <strong>Kings Creek Picnic Area</strong> for lunch. There were well-spaced out picnic tables here under the trees. It was truly peaceful to eat amongst nature here.</li>

<ul>
<li>The most majestic stop was at <strong>Lassen Peak Trailhead</strong>. This is the most popular stop on the road as attested by the huge parking area. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lassen_Peak"><strong>Lassen Peak</strong></a> towers over this trailhead, a strenuous but just 4-hour hike from here. We just hiked a teeny bit to get a better view of the peak and returned.</li>
<li>Right after this were two picture-perfect lakes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Helen_(Lassen_Peak)"><strong>Lake Helen</strong></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerald_Lake_(Lassen_Peak)"><strong>Emerald Lake</strong></a>. Surrounded by 3 mountains around, with crystal clear water lapping on the shore, we loved these stops.</li>
<li><strong>Sulphur Works</strong> is the smelly stop where you can see sulphur and hot mud bubbling out from the earth due to volcanic activity. It is a bit underwhelming compared to what you might imagine.</li>
<li>The final stop on the road was reaching the south-west entrance at the <strong>Kohm Yah-mah-nee Visitor Center</strong>. Disappointingly, their big exhibition area was closed due to COVID, but the big store and outdoor dining area were open for business.</li>
<li>Though we traveled during the CA haze, we were surprisingly spared most of it and we saw memorable vistas on the drive.</li>
<li><strong>Toilets</strong>: All the visitor centers, picnic areas and most of the trailheads have toilets. So you or the kids do not need to worry about that.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="burney-falls">Burney Falls</h2>

</figure>
<p>The morning of the day we checked out, we first made a 1-hour drive up North to see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burney_Falls"><strong>Burney Falls</strong></a>. These majestic and pretty falls are inside the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McArthur%E2%80%93Burney_Falls_Memorial_State_Park"><strong>McArthur-Burney Falls Memorial State Park</strong></a>. There is a $10 entry fee to be paid at the entrance. A short zig-zag trail right near the parking area takes you right in front of this spectacular waterfall. Sadly for us, it was incredibly chilly on our morning near the falls.</p>
