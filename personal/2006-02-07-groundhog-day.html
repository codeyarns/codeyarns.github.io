<p>What would you do if your life had no tomorrow? Everyday you awake and its back to being today again? That's what happens to a weatherman Phil in the movie <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundhog_Day_%28film%29">Groundhog Day</a></strong>. Cynical Phil travels with his producer Rita and cameraman to the small town of Punxsutawney to cover the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundhog_Day">Groundhog Day</a> celebrations. He loathes everything and wishes to get out of the place ASAP. However, he finds out next morning, and for every morning ever after, that he is stuck in the same day in the same town. The only problem being that he can remember all his days whereas for everyone else around him it is a fresh new Groundhog Day. Since none of his actions now have any consequence, he goes around flirting women, breaking the law and even attempts successful suicides. He tries to woo Rita but fails. How does he come out of this endless <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_loop">time loop</a>?</p>
<p>This is a romantic comedy with a quaintly different plot. Good acting by Bill Murray. Yet, you cannot help waiting for the end wishing to see how and when Phil breaks the time loop.</p>
