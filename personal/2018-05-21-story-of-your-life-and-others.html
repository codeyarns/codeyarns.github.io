<p>I quite enjoyed the movie <strong>Arrival</strong> and so naturally ended up picking up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stories_of_Your_Life_and_Others"><strong>Story of your life and others</strong></a>. Written by <strong>Ted Chiang</strong>, this book of 8 science fiction short stories is now rebranded as Arrival, to cash in on the movie's success. These stories were published over a decade between 1990 and 2002 and appear in the book in published order.</p>
<p><strong>The Tower of Babylon</strong> is a perfect example of what Ted Chiang does best. It deftly combines reality, myth and science, showing the social life on such an enormous tower, stretching from earth to Heaven, constantly being built and repaired and climbed by humans. <strong>Understand</strong> is a gripping thriller where a person gains superhuman cognition due a genetic treatment and how his intelligence and perception quickly evolves and runs amok. <strong>Division by Zero</strong>, surrounding a math equation, was the weakest story in the book in my opinion.</p>
<p><strong>The story of your life</strong> is the one on which the movie is based. It presents the intriguing idea of being able to remember your future. However, this is one of those rare scenarios where the movie was actually far more interesting than the story. In <strong>Hell is the absence of God</strong>, Chiang cleverly shifts our current world reality, just a wee little bit. It is a world where people believe in God, angels and miracles, but those visitations are more like natural disasters, leaving people blind or paralyzed due to the energy those acts unleash. <strong>Liking what you see</strong> introduces <em>calliagnosia</em>, a way to induce brain neurons to be immune to facial beauty. The story is a set in a world where people are using it and debates are raging about beauty and the advantages enjoyed by people who have it.</p>
<p>Ted Chiang proves himself to be an extremely good story teller and his attention to detail is immense in these stories. Though I did not find the premise of a few stories to be interesting, the ones I liked are extremely good. Pick up this book and let your imagination take leaps.</p>
