<p>A mysterious microbe lands in a tiny Arizona town and everyone who
breathes it in are killed within minutes due to blood clotting. Only a
drunk old man and a newborn baby survive. A group of four scientists
hunker down in a 5-level high-tech facility to study the microbe and the
survivors in a race to identify the pathogen and find a cure within 5
days.</p>
<p>That’s the premise of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Andromeda_Strain"><strong>The
Andromeda Strain</strong></a>, the first novel of <strong>Michael
Crichton</strong>. The title alludes to the microbe’s codename, it does
not come from another galaxy, but from Earth’s upper atmosphere where it
is captured by a secret military satellite. With the CoVID-19 virus
sweeping the planet, I chose this old favorite as engaging reading
material to match our zeitgeist.</p>
<p>This novel has a fantastic first and second act. I was thoroughly
engaged by the premise and nailbitingly awaited the reveal of why the
baby and old man survived and how the world would be saved. Though a
slim volume, this is technically Cricton’s strongest novel. How bacteria
survives and spreads, composition of proteins, how electron microscopes,
X-ray crystallography, and mass spectrometers work, all feature in the
story. The novel is also way ahead of its time in featuring the
coexistence of humans and bacteria and viruses, what we call microbiome
and virome today. The best thrill is watching the scientists
nerve-wrackingly peel apart the evidence to figure out how the pathogen
spreads and how to stop it.</p>
<p>Sadly, the third act of this novel is weak and fizzles out. That is a
minor quibble for a novel that is tense, engaging and educational upto
that point. This novel was published in 1969, more than 51 years ago,
which is a shock because it has aged so well and the questions raised in
here are still pertinent. A biological techno-thriller not to be
missed.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/4</p>
