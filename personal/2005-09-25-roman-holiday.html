<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/4 (Hepburn in a romantic classic!)</p>
<p>Thanks to a friend at work who is a movie classics fan, I am getting to watch all sorts of old movies. He handed me a VCD of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Holiday">Roman Holiday</a> this week. This B&amp;W movie stars Gregory Peck as an American reporter named Bradley and Audrey Hepburn as a royal named Princess Ann. Ann is on a long visit to Europe and Rome is her last stop. Tired of days full of formal royal events she runs out of her Roman embassy. She meets Bradley and stays at his room. Both of them lie about their real identities. Bradley learns about her identity and wants to milk the situation to get an exclusive interview on her. They go around Rome, enjoying the various places and people. At the end of the day, Ann decides to return to her place since her country is worried that she is missing. And they both realize that they have actually fallen in love.</p>
<p>Audrey Hepburn looks and acts great in the movie, she is especially endearing after she gets her short haircut. She won an Oscar for her role in this movie. The movie ending is uncomplicated, and I liked that. A good romantic classic, though a bit on the lengthier side.</p>
