<h1 class="title">Kids books we loved in 2021</h1>
<p class="date">üìÖ 2021-Apr-23 ‚¨© ‚úçÔ∏è Ashwin Nanjappa ‚¨© üè∑Ô∏è <a href='index.html#book'>book</a> ‚¨© üìö <a href="index.html">Archive</a></p>

<p>Our son turned 6 this year and these are the books that he loved during his KG and Grade 1 phases.</p>
<h2 id="books-he-read">Books he read</h2>
<p>These are the books he was able to read himself, with a bit of help or supervision from one of us.</p>
<h3 id="paul-miesels-books">Paul Miesel‚Äôs books</h3>
<p>See Me Run and See Me Dig. We loved the gorgeous full-spread illustrations that are funny and the text is perfect for kindergarten reading level.</p>
<h3 id="step-into-reading-level-1-books">Step Into Reading Level 1 Books</h3>
<p><strong>Step Into Reading</strong> is a structured series of books by <strong>Penguin Random House</strong> for preschool and elementary school kids. Our son was able to read the <strong>Level 1 (Ready to Read)</strong> books in this series, which is meant for <em>Preschool - Kindergarten</em> kids. We found these books to be perfect for someone who has just learnt to read that year - which is what happens in US kindergarten.</p>
<h3 id="i-can-read-it-all-by-myself-beginner-books">I Can Read It All by Myself Beginner Books</h3>
<p>This is the series of books to which the famous <strong>The Cat in the Hat</strong> belongs. We had tried reading these books to him in the earlier years and they did not really interest him. This year he took a stab again and turns out these books are best for the kid to read himself.</p>
<p>Each book focuses on a certain short rhyming words in a simple poem-like structure. Their beauty comes out when our son started reading them himself and it is a joy to see his confidence grow as he finds that he is finishing pages and pages of this stuff.</p>
<p>This series is so famous and well known that there is a book about this called <strong>I Can Read It All by Myself: The Beginner Books Story</strong> by Paul Allen.</p>
<ul>
<li>Put Me in the Zoo</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="books-we-read-to-him">Books we read to him</h2>
<p>These are primarily the books we would read to him during bedtime.</p>
<h3 id="murilla-gorilla">Murilla Gorilla</h3>
<p>This is a series of 4 books revolving around <strong>Murilla</strong>, an aspiring <em>jungle detective</em> gorilla living in an African rainforest and her crime solving adventures. The books are written by Jennifer Lloyd and illustrated by Jacqui Lee. Murilla is no Sherlock Holmes though, and as she trips and bumbles through the plots, she provides laughs all along the way. These simple crimes all happen in the Mango Market, with a familiar set of African animals who sell and buy stuff there. The plots, characters and fun are all reminiscent of the <a href="2016-11-06-the-no-1-ladies-detective-agency.html"><strong>The No.¬†1 Ladies Detective Agency</strong></a> series. It was also refreshing to read books that are not set in the US for a change.</p>
<ul>
<li>Murilla Gorilla, Jungle Detective</li>
<li>Murilla Gorilla and the Lost Parasol</li>
<li>Murilla Gorilla and the Hammock Problem</li>
<li>Murilla Gorilla and the Missing Mop</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="paddington-books">Paddington books</h3>
<p>We watched the two Paddington movies at home and they were a big hit with our son. I think the first one was really well put together and the second one was just a cash grab. Regardless, I loved this bear character and the world that author Michael Bond had created and decided to check out his original books for my son.</p>
<p>The very first Paddington book sets up the abandoned bear at Paddington station and settles him with the Brown family. Later books are about his adventures with the Brown family and their neighbors. The stories of the book are all funny and feature the fumbles of the innocent bear. The writing quality is top notch, the humor is superlative and it is easy to see why these books are so popular. Reading these stories to my son over dinner became a fun daily exercise.</p>
<ul>
<li>A Bear Called Paddington (1958)</li>
<li>More About Paddington (1959)</li>
<li>Paddington Helps Out (1960)</li>
</ul>
