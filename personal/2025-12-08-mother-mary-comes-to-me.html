<p>I first read <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arundhati_Roy"><strong>Arundhati
Roy</strong></a> when she published <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking_with_the_Comrades"><strong>Walking
with the Comrades</strong></a> in the Outlook magazine. I came away
truly impressed not just with this crazy revealing journey she took, but
also with the quiet power and impact in her writing. In her amazing
ability to wield the English language in a completely new way that
grabbed me by the throat. That ability continues in her latest memoir
<strong>Mother Mary Comes To Me</strong>. This is a book written about
her mother Mary Roy and the junior’s complicated and strained
relationship with her. But what the book actually is, is the closest we
will get to an autobiography of Arundhati Roy, since she covers her
entire life in the book.</p>
<p>The mother is a steely woman, who quickly separates from her drunkard
husband in Assam’s tea estates and moves back to her father’s home in
Ooty with toddler Arundhati and her older brother. She is later kicked
out from there by her mother and brother and ends up back in her home
town of Kottayam. Mother Mary has a volcanic temper and attitude that
erupts on everybody, but especially on her children. She starts a school
there that ends up being her life’s work, as it expands and becomes
highly successful. Arundhati is surrounded by a bunch of highly talented
and accomplished aunts and uncles, probably from whom she gets her
talent with the English language. Not being able to tolerate her
mother’s torture, she leaves to Delhi to study architecture at the first
chance she gets. Her travails in the Delhi school of architecture, lead
her to screenwriting and movies and finally to writing. On the way she
also gets involved in political activism, which is where we find
Arundhati today. Though a violent character, Arundhati continuously
acknowledges that it is her mother who gave her excellent education,
language skills, and a bold temperament, having fought the Travancore
Christian Succession Act all the way to the Supreme Court and won
it.</p>
<p>The book is easy and fast to read. Arundhati’s life is broken down
into chapters that are short and easy to finish. The writing has her
usual quiet dark humor, about her mother, herself, her relatives,
friends and the general state of India. The author does reveal (mostly
anonymously) about her first crushes, her multiple partners in her life
and also the men who harassed her. I clearly felt like this book was the
collection of details of her own life and opinions on her mother that
she <em>had</em> to get out of her system. While her mother is
interesting, it is Arundhati’s life itself that is far more colorful,
having taken surprising turns at every corner.</p>

<h2 id="excerpts">Excerpts</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>I have seen and written about such sorrow, such systemic deprivation,
such unmitigated wickedness, such diverse iterations of hell, that I can
only count myself among the most fortunate. I have thought of my own
life as a footnote to the things that really matter. Never tragic, often
hilarious. Or perhaps this is the lie I tell myself.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I left my mother not because I didn’t love her, but to be able to
continue to love her. Staying would have made that impossible. Once I
left, I didn’t see or speak to her for years. She never looked for me.
She never asked me why I left. There was no need for that. We both
knew.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I learned that day that most of us are a living, breathing soup of
memory and imagination—and that we may not be the best arbiters of which
is which.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To bridge the chasm between the legacy of love she left for those
whose lives she touched and the thorns she set down for me, like little
floaters in my bloodstream–fishhooks that still catch on soft tissue as
my blood makes its way to and from my heart—is why I write this book. It
is as hard to write as it is not to.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I think those years in Ooty were harder for him than for me because
he remembered things. He remembered a better life. He remembered our
father and the big house we had lived in on the tea estate. He
remembered being loved. Fortunately, I didn’t.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In these strange and manifold ways, this constellation of
extraordinary, eccentric, cosmopolitan people, defeated by life,
converged on the tiny village of Ayemenem.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In the Rotary Club my brother and I would help Mrs. Mathews and my
mother to sweep up the cigarette butts and clear away the dirty cups and
glasses left by the members. (All men, of course. To whom it would never
occur to clean or clear away anything.)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Since then, for me, all personal achievement comes with a sense of
foreboding. On the occasions when I am toasted or applauded, I always
feel that someone else, someone quiet, is being beaten in the other
room. If you pause to think about it, it’s true, someone is.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The Naxalite movement was quickly crushed, but every now and then it
rose (rises) in another part of the country. It’s like a dreadful
thermometer that takes our temperature from time to time and tells us
how sick we are.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Like most people in the world, then as well as now, we grew up
between shouting and silence. Some of us made up our own minds, others
had their minds made up for them.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>She kept her married name she said because choosing between a
husband’s name and a father’s name didn’t leave a woman much of a
choice.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I sat on the steps exhausted and oddly relieved. My brother appeared
from nowhere and sat next to me. The silence sat between us like a third
person. A well-loved friend.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>My education, the class I came from, and, above all, the fact that I
spoke English protected me and gave me options that millions of others
did not have. Those were gifts bestowed on me by Mrs. Roy. At no point,
no matter how untenable my circumstance, did I ever forget that.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I didn’t have the bandwidth to accommodate Delhi’s male commuters who
thought of women passengers as snacks they could help themselves to
whenever they felt like it. The indignity made me oscillate between
self-pity and violent fantasies of vengeance. There were days when I
would get off a bus mid-journey and walk, hating myself for the tears of
shame and rage I could not control. Millions of women put up with this
every day.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I said goodbye and shook the hands of those who had hands to
shake.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Nothing made me forget the world like reading did. Nothing made me
think about the world like reading did. Nothing else filled me up.
Nothing else emptied me out. Sentences and paragraphs would drift
through my head like clouds. Kipling, Shakespeare, the opening passage
of Lolita, G. Isaac’s sentences purloined from Joyce’s Ulysses—“Belluomo
rises from the bed of his wife’s lover’s wife, the kerchiefed housewife
is astir”—streaked like comets across my reading sky. I waited for
“crude sunlight on her lemon streets” (which never came) and mornings
that would qualify as “rosy-fingered dawn” (which did). I shuddered at
the thought of Leopold Bloom slipping a kidney wrapped in paper into his
pocket and taking it home for his wife’s faintly urine-scented
breakfast.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Even then I knew that the language I wrote in was not mine. By mine I
don’t mean mother tongue, and by language I don’t mean English, Hindi,
or Malayalam, I mean a writer’s language. Language that I used, not
language that used me. A language in which I could describe my
multilingual world to myself. I knew even then that that language was
outside me, not inside me. I knew it would not come to me on its own. I
needed to hunt it down like prey. Disembowel it, eat it. And when I did,
I knew that language, my language, would ease the way blood flowed
through my body. It was out there somewhere, a live language-animal, a
striped and spotted thing, grazing, waiting for me the predator. That
was the law of my jungle. It wasn’t a nonviolent, vegetarian dream.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Micky and Mary Roy. Thinking about them as a couple makes me laugh. I
cannot imagine them being married for even five minutes, let alone five
years. Which God, which stars, in which heaven made that happen? He,
defeated in every possible way. She, successful, admired, and
loved—adored—in every possible way. His spirit so light and rascally.
Hers so heavy, so unhappy. But often, in her own way, extremely naughty,
too. Their paths must have crossed while she was angrily rolling her
rock uphill and he was cheerfully hurtling downhill with his.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Indian mothers and their obsession with their sons. They’ll blindside
you. Come at you from every angle. Even if they criticize their sons,
quarrel with them, they cannot see beyond them.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It was a clear, beautiful night. We passed a buffalo cart with a
lantern tied behind it for a taillight. The driver of the cart was lying
on his back, singing to the stars, confident that his buffalo would take
him home. I remember feeling jealous of him. I remember thinking that no
matter how long and hard we fought, in India no woman of any religion,
class, caste, or creed would ever feel safe enough to sing to the stars
on a lonely highway while her buffalo took her home.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Houses–inherited houses–own people and not the other way around.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I wasn’t Christian enough. I wasn’t Hindu enough. I wasn’t communist
enough. I wasn’t enough.</p>
</blockquote>
