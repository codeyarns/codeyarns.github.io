<p>Any time is a good time to watch <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_Is_Beautiful"><strong>Life is
Beautiful</strong></a> (<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_Is_Beautiful"><strong>La vita è
bella</strong></a>) a 1997 Italian movie directed by <strong>Roberto
Benigni</strong>. Set in Italy at the onset of WWII, Guido (the director
himself) is an Italian Jew who arrives at the historic city of
<strong>Arezzo</strong> to work at his uncle’s hotel. Guido has the
power to squeeze laughs out of the most serious situations of life. It
is this humour which wins him over a beautiful wife (played by his
actual wife) and soon they have a son. His charm is put to its hardest
test when his family is arrested and taken to a Nazi concentration camp.
Pulling every possible trick out of his hat, Guido convinces his son
that they are playing a grand game at the concentration camp and with
his wit manages to save him from death. Tragedy follows when USA
advances into Germany and the Nazis decide to kill all the prisoners and
escape.</p>
<p>Life is Beautiful presents a most sunny take on the darkest facet of
WWII. The movie is funny, all through Guido’s romance and family life to
his travails at the Nazi concentration camp. The European settings are
splendid, the grand old buildings and alleys of Arezzo are a must-watch,
the acting is excellent and it is hard to pick a flaw in the movie. The
ending is bittersweet and it left me wishing it was a completely happy
climax. Life is Beautiful is an awesome family movie on the power humans
have to foster happiness in the most trying of times.</p>
