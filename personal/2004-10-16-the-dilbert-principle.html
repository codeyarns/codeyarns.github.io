<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 4/4 (Funny and entertaining)</p>
<p>In <em><a
href="http://www.amazon.com/Dilbert-Principle-Cubicles-Eye-Management-Afflictions/dp/0887308589">The
Dilbert Principle</a></em>, his book on mis-management, Scott Adams
gives us a comical view of corporate culture, bosses, budgets, meetings,
projects, team-building exercises(!) and lots of such workplace
irritations that bug most employees. Almost every statement Adams makes
is substantiated with a funny strip from the incomparable Dilbert
archives. In his prose, he is very tongue-in-cheek, provocative and
funny. You can expect an average of 2 Dilbert strips or more per page
(the book has 336 pages, you do the math). Also, he quotes several of
the emails he has received from his fans about the stupid acts of their
bosses and management. In the end, he also proposes a new company model:
<em>OA5</em>. The core principles being happy employees and efficiency.
If you love Dilbert (either because you find it funny or because you
actually live in a Dilbert-like workplace), you will thoroughly enjoy
reading this book. Highly recommended!</p>
<p>I almost forgot to mention, <em>The Dilbert Principle</em> is:</p>
<blockquote>
The most ineffective workers are systematically moved to the place where
they can do the least damage - management.
</blockquote>
