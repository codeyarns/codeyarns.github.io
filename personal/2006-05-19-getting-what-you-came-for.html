<p>I read the book Getting What You Came For (The Smart Student’s Guide
To Earning A Master’s Or Ph.D.) written by Robert L. Peters. This is a
revised edition published in 1997, but most of the stuff holds good even
now. The author gives tips for everything from the time you are in
undergrad, applying for grad studies, choosing your adviser, doing
research, getting your thesis done, dealing with stress and managing
time. The book is quite comprehensive in its coverage. I skipped over
chapters which weren’t relevant for me. The ones which I found most
useful were the tips about managing time and stress. Hopefully, I should
be able to deal with this better now. I think this book helped me quite
a bit (if only I can apply whatever I’ve learnt in it). I recommend it
to all who are finding grad school hard and stressful. The only downside
of the book was that it has very few engineering/science specific
advice.</p>
