<p>For years I had been ambiguous about Stephen Covey’s book <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Seven_Habits_of_Highly_Effective_People">The
Seven Habits Of Highly Effective People</a>. It was mentioned all over
the place, but it seemed like a cheesy self-help book, the kind which I
abhored, but then it was mentioned by friends who I look up to.
Recently, Randy Pausch mentioned it in his talk on <em><a
href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTugjssqOT0">Time
Management</a></em> and I finally decided to give it a shot.</p>
<p>While the packaging and the 7 in the title seem to give the picture
of yet-another-quick-self-help book, after reading it I didn’t get that
perception. You could replace the <em>effective</em> in <em>Highly
Effective People</em> with happy, content or peaceful and the book would
still make sense. Covey tries to share his learnings of how to gain
independence in personal life and interdependence in societal life using
7 habits. The stress all through the book is that there are no
shortcuts, a person has to base his life on principles and constantly
practise the right learnings/actions until they become habits. (This is
something that I’m finding out is very true personally.)</p>
<p>The 3 habits to gain personal independence:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Be proactive. – Humans have the capability to think about their
own actions and thoughts. Hence, they can change their actions. Try to
change if you’re not happy with yourself.</p></li>
<li><p>Begin with the end in mind. – Very reminiscent of Steve Jobs in
his Stanford commencement speech. It’s important to base daily life and
actions on some personal principles, goals and missions.</p></li>
<li><p>Put first things first. – This section introduces Covey’s
quadrant. (Even if you don’t read the book, this quadrant is very useful
for folks interested in time and life management.) Quadrant I tasks are
important and due immediately. Quadrant II tasks are important but
long-term. Most people ignore QII tasks for QI tasks. In the long term,
it is beneficial to slowly turn around our living style to take on more
QII tasks and reduce the QI tasks.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The 3 habits to gain interdependence:</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li><p>Think Win/Win. – A philosophy very similar to the <em><a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_way">Middle Way</a></em> in
Buddhism. (I surely need to read more about this.) Instead of seeking to
Win/Lose or Lose/Win with others, try to always aim for a scenario where
both you and others gain.</p></li>
<li><p>Seek first to understand, then to be understood.</p></li>
<li><p>Synergize.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Habit 7 is Sharpen The Saw, that is to regularly apply these
principles, until they become habits.</p>
<p>The book is a breezy read, lots of quotes, stories and analogies.
This is a good read, I could agree with the author on a lot of his views
and I definitely took away a lot from the book.</p>
<hr />
<p>Some titbits from the book:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a
habit.” – Aristotle</p>
<hr />
<p>Until a person can say deeply and honestly, “I am what I am today
because of the choices I made yesterday,” that person cannot say, “I
choose otherwise.”</p>
<hr />
<p>Malcom Muggeridge writes in “A Twentieth-Century Testimony”:</p>
<p>When I look back on my life nowadays, which I sometimes do, what
strikes me most forcibly about it is that what seemed at the time most
significant and seductive, seems now most futile and absurd. For
instance, success in all of its various guises; being known and being
praised; ostensible pleasures, like acquiring money or seducing women,
or traveling, going to and fro in the world and up and down in it like
Satan, explaining and experiencing whatever Vanity Fair has to
offer.</p>
<p>In retrospect, all these exercises in self-gratification seem pure
fantasy, what Pascal called, “licking the earth.”</p>
<hr />
<p>[…] enemy centering is very common, particularly when there is
frequent interaction between people who are in real conflict. When
someone feels he has been unjustly dealt with by an emotionally or
socially significant person, it is very easy for him to become
preoccupied with the injustice and make the other person the center of
his life. Rather than proactively leading his own life, the
enemy-centered person is counterdependently reacting to the behavior and
attitudes of a perceived enemy.</p>
<hr />
<p>In Frankl’s words, “Everyone has his own specific vocation or mission
in life. Therein he cannot be replaced, nor can his life be repeated.
Thus, everyone’s task is as unique as is his specific opportunity to
implement it.”</p>
<hr />
<p>Dr. Charles Garfield has done extensive research on peak performers,
both in athletics and in business. […] One of the main things his
research showed was that almost all of the world-class athletes and
other peak performers are visualizers. They see it; they feel it; they
experience it before they actually do it. They Begin with the End in
Mind.</p>
<hr />
<p>(On why writing down goals and thoughts in journals is important
…)</p>
<p>Writing distills, crystallizes, and clarifies thought and helps break
the whole into parts.</p>
<hr />
<p>“Things which matter most must never be at the mercy of things which
matter least.” – Goethe</p>
<hr />
<p>One of my favorite essays is “The Common Denominator of Success,”
written by E. M. Gray. He spent his life searching for the one
denominator that all successful people share. He found it wasn’t hard
work, good luck, or astute human relations, though those were all
important. […] “The successful person has the habit of doing the things
failures don’t like to do,” he observed. “They don’t like doing them
either necessarily. But their disliking is subordinated to the strength
of their purpose.”</p>
<hr />
<p>[…] people see the world, not as it is, but as they are.</p>
<hr />
<p>Arthur Gordon shares a wonderful, intimate story of his own spiritual
renewal in a little story called “<a
href="http://www.achievemax.com/blog/2007/10/04/the-turn-of-the-tide/">The
Turn of the Tide</a>.”</p>
<hr />
<p>“The person who doesn’t read is no better off than the person who
can’t read.”</p>
<hr />
<p>In the words of Phillips Brooks: “Some day, in the years to come, you
will be wrestling with the great temptation, or trembling under the
great sorrow of your life. But the real struggle is here, now. Now it is
being decided whether, in the day of your supreme sorrow or temptation,
you shall miserably fail or gloriously conquer. Character cannot be made
except by a steady, long continued process.”</p>
<hr />
<p>Goethe taught, “Treat a man as he is and he will remain as he is.
Treat a man as he can and should be and he will become as he can and
should be.”</p>
<hr />
<p>Emerson: “That which we persist in doing becomes easier – not that
the nature of the task has changed, but our ability to do has
increased.”</p>
<hr />
T. S. Eliot expresses so beautifully my own personal discovery and
conviction: “We must not cease from exploration. And the end of all our
exploring will be to arrive where we began and to know the place for the
first time.”
