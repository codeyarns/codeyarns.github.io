<p>Saw the Friday movie Welcome To Mooseport. A retired US president Eagle (Gene Hackman) moves to a small town named Mooseport to work on his lucrative book deals and lectures in peace. Peace is not what he gets. He is thrust into the mayoral election for the town against the town plumber Handy (Ray Romano). Handy is pretty miffed since the prez is also dating his girlfriend of 6 years. The whole media converges on the small town to cover this event. Does the prez win the election? Does Handy win his girlfriend back?</p>
<p>Gene Hackman is perfectly suited for the role of a retired president. Ray Romano is cool in his non-comedy role. Decent comedy movie.</p>
