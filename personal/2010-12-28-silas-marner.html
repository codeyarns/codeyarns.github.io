<p>These busy times have made it very hard for me to find the time and
motivation to re-read a good book from the past. I somehow managed to
pick up <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silas_Marner"><strong>Silas
Marner</strong></a> by <strong>George Eliot</strong> this weekend. From
the very opening line of the book rolled in vivid memories from middle
school! 😊 Our young and energetic new English teacher had chosen this
book as our non-detailed textbook for the English class. If <a
href="2010-11-14-alices-adventures-in-wonderland.html"><strong>Alice in
Wonderland</strong></a> was the first real book-length book I enjoyed,
Silas Marner was the first prescribed book that captured my imagination.
A good teacher can make any subject interesting, and our new teacher
surely fit that bill. Was it those rapturous noon readings in class by a
fantastic teacher or the biblical tale of a lonely forsaken creature, I
cannot tell which. Silas ended up becoming a character so graphic and
real that, even in middle school, I really thought I could feel his
pain. At its heart, Silas Marner is the story of redemption. Silas is a
weaver who is cheated out of his wife and life by a close friend. Losing
all interest in social ties, he settles down on the fringe of a hamlet
called Raveloe. He focuses only on weaving and with his miserly ways
soon collects a large amount of gold. Bereft of human contact, the gold
becomes his life. He is completely shattered when his gold is stolen one
night. Seeking the help of the villagers to find the thief, Silas slowly
warms up to them. Soon after, a dying woman leaves a golden haired baby
at his hearth. It is this gurgling baby that brings closure to Silas’s
life. He soon loves her more than his previous gold and dedicates his
life to bringing her up. The cute baby becomes the cord that binds Silas
and the villagers.</p>

<p>Except for a few middle chapters which are quite prolix, Silas Marner
is solid English prose and it is no surprise that it is a classic of
English literature. It is a short, tight read, unlike the verbosity of
<strong>Charles Dickens</strong>, who was also writing at the time of
this book. While the secondary characters are used skillfully to
complete the story, the book solely rests on the bent back of the lonely
weaver. The murky image of Silas plodding slowly through misty late
evening light on a lonely road is sure to haunt any reader for life! His
story becomes our story and his pain ours. I found it hard not to
empathize with his predicaments and the book has the power to leave one
somber long after the last page has been turned.</p>
<p>As I learned from a recent <strong>In Our Time</strong> <a
href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00q4310">episode on this
book</a>, George Eliot is the male pen-name of <strong>Mary Anne
Stevens</strong>. One of her other books that I hope to read sometime is
<strong>Mill on the Floss</strong>. I read Silas Marner this time from
an Everyman edition, edited by Anne Smith. The book has a good
introduction to George Eliot, her life and times and the setting of
Raveloe and its villagers. Special mention goes out to the beautiful
cover of this edition, from a painting called <strong>The Cottage
Home</strong> by William Snape, which I found to fit the story well. The
yellowed pages of Silas Marner gave me a melancholic Sunday afternoon
and I hope I can do it again in a few years.</p>
<hr />
<p>A few memorable excerpts from the book:</p>
<p>The beautiful opening quote …</p>
<blockquote>
“A child, more than all other gifts That earth can offer to declining
man, Brings hope with it, and forward-looking thoughts.” – Wordsworth
</blockquote>
<p>The villagers did not trust Silas because they believed he had secret
powers …</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[…] the rude mind with difficulty associates the ideas of power and
benignity.</p>
A shadowy conception of power that by much persuasion can be induced to
refrain from inflicting harm, is the shape most easily taken by the
sense of the Invisible in the minds of men who have always been pressed
close by primitive wants, and to whom a life of hard toil has never been
illuminated by any enthusiastic religious faith.  To them pain and
mishap present a far wider range of possibilities than gladness and
enjoyment: their imagination is almost barren of the images that feed
desire and hope, but is all overgrown by recollections that are a
perpetual pasture to fear.
</blockquote>
<p>Silas would have episodes of the fits …</p>
<blockquote>
[…] there might be such a thing as a man’s soul being loose from his
body, and going out and in, like a bird out of its nest and back.
</blockquote>
<p>George Eliot speaks out against religion sometimes in the book. Here
is Silas when his friend cheats him …</p>
<blockquote>
“[…] there is no just God that governs the earth righteously, but a God
of lies, that bears witness against the innocent.”
</blockquote>
<p>With his life stolen from him Silas becomes a shell of his former
self …</p>
<blockquote>
[…] like a rivulet that has sunk far down from the grassy fringe of its
old breadth into a little shivering thread, that cuts a groove for
itself in the barren sand.
</blockquote>
<p>The loneliness of Silas in achingly beautiful words …</p>
<blockquote>
[…] as he sat in his loneliness by his dull fire, he leaned his elbows
on his knees, and clasped his head with his hands, and moaned very low.
</blockquote>
<p>The child shows Silas a whole new life …</p>
<blockquote>
As the child’s mind was growing into knowledge, his mind was growing
into memory: as her life unfolded, his soul, long stupefied in a cold
narrow prison, was unfolding too, and trembling gradually into full
consciousness.
</blockquote>
