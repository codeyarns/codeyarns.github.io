<p>A few years ago, <strong>Joel Spolsky</strong> decided to show the
world how software is created. He invited a documentary crew to film the
summer interns at his company <strong>Fog Creek</strong> create what was
code-named <a href="http://www.projectaardvark.com/"><strong>Project
Aardvark</strong></a>. It would be later branded as the product <a
href="https://www.copilot.com/"><strong>Copilot</strong></a>. This
documentary was named <strong>Aardvark’d: 12 Weeks with Geeks</strong>
and sold on DVD. The entire movie is now available on Youtube <a
href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NRL7YsXjSg">here</a>.</p>
<p>When there is some problem on their computer, a lot of people ask
their family or friends to help fix it. Most of the time the helpers are
physically far away. So, Project Aardvark set about creating a website
which could connect the seeker and the helper, the helper could view and
interact with the seeker’s desktop and hopefully fix the problem.</p>
<p>Aardvark’d follows the four interns: three programmers and one
marketer as they go about learning and creating this software. I have
nothing more to say because this Aardvark’d is super-boring, watching
paint dry would be more exciting than this. Neither do we get to see the
daily hustle-bustle life of a Fog Creek employee nor are we given the
technical insight into Project Aardvark. Instead we are fed shots of the
interns sitting at their computer working, some stupid contests and some
talking points from Joel Spolsky and Paul Graham.</p>
<p>Aardvark’d is a mega-bore of a documentary and I highly recommend
avoiding spending the one hour or so of your life on it. Just watch the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3dTxIjEeRw">trailer</a>,
believe me when I say that there is <em>absolutely nothing</em> more to
see in the movie than what is shown in the 2 minutes of that
trailer.</p>
