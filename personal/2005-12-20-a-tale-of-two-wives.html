<p>Caught an afternoon comedy movie called A Tale Of Two Wives. As the title says, Paul Gallagher, a shrink is married to 2 women. His first wife is an author and the second is a pianist. He is able to manage them both without each of them knowing he is married to the other. Thankfully for him, they are on the opposite sides of the Atlantic. He switches back and forth on alternate weeks between NYC and London practising in both places and thus balancing his wives. His life goes haywire when they discover each other and decide to take revenge by screwing up his life.</p>
<p>This is tried-n-tested Bollywood wine now in a Hollywood bottle. The movie though funny at times doesn't really rise to the level that our desi versions can notch up to. Can't beat the experts at their game can you? Mediocre.</p>
