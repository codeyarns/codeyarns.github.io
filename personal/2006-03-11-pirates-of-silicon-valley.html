<p>Oh yeah, I finally caught up with Pirates Of Silicon Valley. The
movie captures the stories of <em>Apple</em> (Steve Jobs / Steve
Wozniak) and <em>MicroSoft</em> (Bill Gates / Paul Allen / Steve
Ballmer) from their start upto 1997. We get to see how Jobs and Woz run
their company in their garage until venture capital shows up. On the
other side of the coin, there is Gates and Allen fooling IBM into
thinking that they have written a DOS. Jobs has severe problems with his
wife Arlene and with accepting her daughter Lisa as his own. Apple after
a visit to Xerox then incorporates those ideas in their OS and
computers. Later, Gates does the same to Apple when he steals their
ideas into Windows. Jobs tears apart Apple by overworking the employees
and by breaking them into Mac and Lisa camps and pitting each against
the other. The movie ends with Gates becoming the richest man on the
planet, Jobs being fired and accepting his children and Woz leaving the
whole circus to go teach computers to children.</p>
<p>This movie is riveting! It concentrates more on the personal lives of
the people involved than on the technical issues. I liked that. The
acting by these unheard actors Noah Wyle (Steve Jobs) and Anthony
Michael Hall (Bill Gates) is top-notch. They look and talk exactly like
you’d expect their characters to. The movie is also interesting cause of
how MicroSoft and Apple are pitted against each other today just like
before. Must watch!</p>
