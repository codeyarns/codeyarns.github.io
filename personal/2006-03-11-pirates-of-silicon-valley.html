<p>Oh yeah, I finally caught up with Pirates Of Silicon Valley. The movie captures the stories of <em>Apple</em> (Steve Jobs / Steve Wozniak) and <em>MicroSoft</em> (Bill Gates / Paul Allen / Steve Ballmer) from their start upto 1997. We get to see how Jobs and Woz run their company in their garage until venture capital shows up. On the other side of the coin, there is Gates and Allen fooling IBM into thinking that they have written a DOS. Jobs has severe problems with his wife Arlene and with accepting her daughter Lisa as his own. Apple after a visit to Xerox then incorporates those ideas in their OS and computers. Later, Gates does the same to Apple when he steals their ideas into Windows. Jobs tears apart Apple by overworking the employees and by breaking them into Mac and Lisa camps and pitting each against the other. The movie ends with Gates becoming the richest man on the planet, Jobs being fired and accepting his children and Woz leaving the whole circus to go teach computers to children.</p>
<p>This movie is riveting! It concentrates more on the personal lives of the people involved than on the technical issues. I liked that. The acting by these unheard actors Noah Wyle (Steve Jobs) and Anthony Michael Hall (Bill Gates) is top-notch. They look and talk exactly like you'd expect their characters to. The movie is also interesting cause of how MicroSoft and Apple are pitted against each other today just like before. Must watch!</p>
