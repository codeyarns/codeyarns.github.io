<p>I watch <strong>The Daily Show</strong> regularly, where <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aasif_Mandvi"><strong>Aasif
Mandvi</strong></a> appears frequently acting as a reporter. So, I was
pretty interested to check out <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Today%27s_Special_%282009_film%29"><strong>Today’s
Special</strong></a>, when I learnt that it was written by him, based on
his Broadway play <strong>Sakina’s Restaurant</strong>.</p>
<p>Sameer (Aasif Mandvi) is a sous chef at a French restaurant in NYC,
hoping to break into the big league. Fate has other plans for him, when
his father has a heart attack and he is forced to run his failing Indian
restaurant business. Not knowing much about Indian cooking, Sameer hires
Akbar (Naseeruddin Shah), a charming quote-spewing jack-of-all-trades
cab driver as the cook. With his cooking-from-the-gut method, Akbar has
patrons asking for more. Not surprisingly, Sameer re-discovers his South
Asian roots and succeeds.</p>
<p>There is absolutely nothing special about Today’s Special. Anyone who
has watched a few movies of this genre can precisely predict what
exactly will happen next in the movie at any time. What makes this movie
warm and fun to watch are the actors. There is seemingly no end to the
talent of Naseeruddin Shah, plop him into any movie and he will delight
you. Given a character with a free-wheeling spirit here, he seems to be
have a lot of fun playing the role. On The Daily Show, Aasif only gets
to play extremely straitjacketed roles. Given the broader stage of the
movie here, he too lets loose and turns out to be a surprisingly warm
actor. As a bonus, the movie has quite a few delicious food-porn scenes
and pithy food-philosophy lines from Shah. Today’s Special may not be a
shahi biryani, but it certainly has the simple joy of a good dal.</p>
