<p>To be honest, I did not really believe that <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four"><strong>Nineteen
Eighty-Four</strong></a> would be any different from the other two of
the dystopian triad: <a
href="2006-09-24-brave-new-world.html"><strong>Brave New
World</strong></a> and <a
href="2007-02-11-fahrenheit-451.html"><strong>Fahrenheit
451</strong></a>. While I was proved right, this work by <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Orwell"><strong>George
Orwell</strong></a> turned out to be the most terrifying of the three.
In 1984, the world is a surveillance state where everyone is constantly
monitored by <strong>telescreens</strong>. Any deviant behavior will
lead to re-education, hard labor, torture or even death. The protagonist
<strong>Winston Smith</strong> works at the <strong>Ministry of
Truth</strong>, where he (ironically) alters past news articles to match
the present reality. Everything from books, to communication to thoughts
have to toe the <strong>Party</strong> line. Everyone is beholden to the
ultimate Party leader, the <strong>Big Brother</strong>, whose face is
plastered everywhere, but whom no one has seen. The Party pummels the
citizens with 24/7 propaganda, with hate speeches about
counter-revolutionaries, faked successes of the Party and Big Brother.
Winston constantly wonders if he is the only one who can see how fake
the entire setup is. He cannot talk or write about this due to the
constant surveillance by Spies and the <strong>Thought Police</strong>.
After a lifetime of this hell, he finally finds a like-minded companion
in Julia. And they seem to have discovered some counter-revolutionaries
who plan to overthrow the Party too. But the world is not what it seems
as they are about to find out.</p>
<p>1984 has three clear acts. The first part sets up the surveillance
state. Written in 1949, this futuristic imagination of the state by
Orwell is easily the best and most memorable part of the book. The
details of life, language, work, family and love in this state are
meticulously described and it is quite believable. You will walk away
with an entire dystopian jargon that Orwell has created for this world:
words like doublethink, thoughtcrime and NewsSpeak. I would not be
surprised if this book was and is still banned in many countries, like
China, Russia and North Korea. The second act of the book is quite weak,
with a fairytale romance and long chapters from the
counter-revolutionary book. But the entry to the third act is a total
shocker, it blew my mind. The climax is pure horror and insanity. The
ending is meh, but then there is no way Orwell could have satisfactorily
beaten his fantastic premise anyway. Nitpicks aside, 1984 is a
brilliantly imagined vision and a sucker punch of a book.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/4</p>
<p><strong>ISBN:</strong> 9780141391700</p>
