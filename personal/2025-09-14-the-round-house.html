<p><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Round_House_(novel)"><strong>The
Round House</strong></a> is set in an Ojibwe <em>reservation</em> in
North Dakota in the 1980s. The story is <strong>Joe’s</strong>
recolletion of his 13th summer, when his mother
<strong>Geraldine</strong> returns home from a violent sexual assault
and an attempt on her life. Traumatized, his mother does not speak or
leave her bedroom, leaving it to Joe and his lawyer dad
<strong>Bazil</strong> to figure out who they know in the reservation
did this. This time is also a prime summer in this teenager’s life and
he has great adventures on the reservation with his buddy Cappy, plays
tricks on the Catholic priest Travis, they fall in love with the
visiting missionary girl Zalia, act out their crushes on older women,
and participate in their community’s secret rituals. In the end, Joe
finds the attacker, and needs to make the decision of whether to kill
him himself.</p>
<p>Written by native American author <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louise_Erdrich"><strong>Louise
Erdrich</strong></a> this novel is less of a whodunit and more of a
coming-of-age story steeped in the reservation life, history and
practices. I have been fortunate to have read <a
href="2024-10-31-bad-indians.html"><strong>Bad Indians</strong></a> and
<a href="2024-11-24-a-council-of-dolls.html"><strong>A Council of
Dolls</strong></a> recently and so their grounding helped me fully
experience the telling here. Louise is masterful at pulling us into
intriguing people and events, while the genocidal elimination, oppressed
history of her people, the influence of forced Catholic conversion,
Catholic boarding school, poverty and alcoholism in reservation life
loom silently in the background. The real shocker of the book is the
powerless justice system in the reservations, since the US justice
system does not allow them to prosecute non-Native people who commit
crimes on reservation grounds. The characters all get their own
interesting back stories and so remain memorable. Native American way of
speaking, native names, words, are all weaved naturally into the
writing. None of the conversations are double quoted in this book, which
was a surprise. I think this was a great book, not just about Native
American life and tragedy, but also rich enough to let me soak again in
my childhood summer memories.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/5</p>
<h2 id="excerpts">Excerpts</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>They lived and died too quickly in those years that surrounded the
making of the reservation, died before they could be recorded and in
such painful numbers that it was hard to remember them all without
uttering, as my father did sometimes as he read local history, and the
white man appeared and drove them down into the earth, which sounded
like an Old Testament prophecy but was just an observation of the
truth.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When you are little, you do not know that you are screaming or
crying—your feelings and the sound that comes out of you is all one
thing. I remember that I opened my mouth, that is all, and that I did
not shut it until I was back with Mom.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>My mother was up, in the bathroom making brushing and washing sounds.
I listened to the shower water rattle down. The hotel curtains were so
heavy I didn’t know that it was pouring outside too. One of those rare
August rains that tamp down the dust flares on the roads had just begun.
A rain that washes the whitened dust-coated leaves. A rain that fills
the cracks in the earth and revives the brown grasses. That grows the
corn by a foot and makes a second cutting of hay possible. A gentle rain
that lasts for days. There was a chill in the air that persisted all the
way home. My mother drove with the windshield wipers going. The coziest
of sounds to a boy drowsing in the backseat. My father stayed alert
beside my mother, covered with a quilt. From time to time I’d open my
eyes, just to see them. He had his hand across the seat, resting on her
leg above the knee. Occasionally she took one hand off the wheel,
reached down, and rested her hand on top of his.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As happens sometimes drifting out of an unexpected sleep, I did not
know exactly where I was. I kept my eyes closed. My mother’s voice and
the childhood sensation of her hand stroking my ankle, which was always
how she woke me, flooded me with peace. I allowed my consciousness to
sink to an even younger hiding place where nothing could touch me.</p>
