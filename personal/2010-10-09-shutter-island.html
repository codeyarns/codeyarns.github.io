<p>I am always open to a good mystery like <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shutter_Island_%28film%29"><strong>Shutter
Island</strong></a>. It had me enraptured when I saw it on a recent
Emirates flight. Leonardo DiCaprio is a US marshal who arrives at a
mysterious prison-hospital on an island to investigate the disappearance
of an inmate. Not only is he dogged by the suspicious behaviour of the
hospital staff, he is also having nightmares of his murder of a Nazi
officer during WWII. His (now dead) wife also starts to appear in his
dreams and even daytime hallucinations. His investigation starts to
reveal that the hospital is not all what it seems, but is being used to
conduct secret tests on the inmates.</p>
<p>Coming in the same year as <a
href="2010-07-25-inception.html"><strong>Inception</strong></a> and
starring the same Leonardo DiCaprio, <strong>Shutter Island</strong> too
relies on distortion of reality. Leonardo DiCaprio and Ben Kingsley
deliver supreme performances, an Oscar for either would not be
surprising. Directed by Martin Scorsese, the movie is a fantastic
mystery set in dark and rainy conditions on a desolate island. It has a
strong plot, tightly told and is a thrill to watch. <strong>Shutter
Island</strong> is an awesome watch guaranteed to take the viewer on a
thrilling ride.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/4 (A mystery guaranteed to take the viewer
on a thrilling ride.)</p>
