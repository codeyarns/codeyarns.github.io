<p>Saw another Kubrick movie â€” Dr. Strangelove Or: How I Learned To Stop Worrying And Love The Bomb which is a highly acclaimed satirical movie. Ripper, a mad USAF general orders his B-52 bombers to nuke Russia. He also convinces his airbase that they are under attack by Commies. The President calls for an emergency meeting in the Pentagon war room. The Prez is level headed but his USAF air chief is war loving. Eventually after an attack on Ripper's airbase they are able to get the code with which they can order the cancellation of the nuke attack. But, a lone B-52 bomber is out of radio contact and it goes ahead with the plan. The talks between the US and Russian presidents fail. Also, the Russian <em>doomsday device</em> is activated automatically (it is built that way) due to the nuke explosion and it destroys the entire planet.</p>
<p>The movie starts off with such pleasing music, it almost seemed romantic. Though very satirical, the subject it deals with is very serious (and holds true to this day). Kubrick maintains his penchant for authenticity by depicting the nuking procedure and the B-52 plane internals in excellent detail. The main characters are simply hilarious. There are double entendres all over the place if you can spot them. The main theme of the movie is that in a nuclear war, there are no winners. There are many iconic scenes from this movie you'd seen elsewhere in many places (like the Pentagon war room, Major Kong riding the bomb etc.). Good movie.</p>
