<p>Saw another Kubrick movie — Dr. Strangelove Or: How I Learned To Stop
Worrying And Love The Bomb which is a highly acclaimed satirical movie.
Ripper, a mad USAF general orders his B-52 bombers to nuke Russia. He
also convinces his airbase that they are under attack by Commies. The
President calls for an emergency meeting in the Pentagon war room. The
Prez is level headed but his USAF air chief is war loving. Eventually
after an attack on Ripper’s airbase they are able to get the code with
which they can order the cancellation of the nuke attack. But, a lone
B-52 bomber is out of radio contact and it goes ahead with the plan. The
talks between the US and Russian presidents fail. Also, the Russian
<em>doomsday device</em> is activated automatically (it is built that
way) due to the nuke explosion and it destroys the entire planet.</p>
<p>The movie starts off with such pleasing music, it almost seemed
romantic. Though very satirical, the subject it deals with is very
serious (and holds true to this day). Kubrick maintains his penchant for
authenticity by depicting the nuking procedure and the B-52 plane
internals in excellent detail. The main characters are simply hilarious.
There are double entendres all over the place if you can spot them. The
main theme of the movie is that in a nuclear war, there are no winners.
There are many iconic scenes from this movie you’d seen elsewhere in
many places (like the Pentagon war room, Major Kong riding the bomb
etc.). Good movie.</p>
