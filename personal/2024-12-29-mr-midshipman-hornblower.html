<p>I recently learnt that there was a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horatio_Hornblower">Hornblower
series</a> of naval adventures that is similar to my favorite <a
href="2014-12-16-master-and-commander.html">Aubrey-Maturin novels</a>.
And that led me to start with the first book <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Midshipman_Hornblower"><strong>Mr. Midshipman
Hornblower</strong></a>. Both the series are centered around characters
on British naval fighting ships during the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleonic_Wars">Napoleonic
Wars</a>.</p>
<p>In this first book, we watch <em>Hornblower</em> start his career as
a midshipman (entry level in officer rank) and get promoted to
Lieutenant by the end. Though he is tormented by a terrible bully on his
first ship, he snags a transfer to the <em>Indefatigable</em> under
<em>Captain Pellew</em> that kick starts his career. Each of the several
chapters in the book deal with separate adventures he is involved in
while the ship scours the coasts of France and Spain, trying to pick off
enemy merchant ships or fight their naval vessels. Towards the middle of
the book, Spain aligns with France and that leaves Britain with just the
single port of Gibraltor along that coastline. Life thrusts Hornblower
into increasing levels of responsibility, independence and danger
through the chapters. Though barely 20, his feet are put to the fire and
he is forced to pick and choose between the lives of the men under him.
He is able to use his inexperience to devise innovative strategies to
win battles for his captain. Through inexperience and bad timing, a few
of his tasks fail and in the end he is captured and imprisoned by Spain.
The novel ends on a happy note, when through his bravado in saving
innocent Spanish lives, he is freed and the British promote him to
Lieutenant.</p>
<p>This series written by <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._S._Forester"><strong>C. S.
Forester</strong></a> was a great discovery for me. I found this first
novel quite riveting, finding parallels to Hornblower’s journey in my
own fatherhood and career. A single arc might have resulted in a
stronger novel, but the singular chapters are all interesting too on
their own. After a long while, I was looking up sailing-ship jargon,
living on a ship and getting lost in the history and places of the
Napoleonic era.</p>
<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 4/5</p>
