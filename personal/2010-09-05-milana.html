<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 3/4 (An endearing romantic drama.)</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milana"><strong>Milana</strong></a> (‡≤Æ‡≤ø‡≤≤‡≤®) is a 2007 romantic drama starring <strong>Puneeth Rajkumar</strong> and <strong>Parvathi Menon</strong> in her debut role. Akash (Puneeth) marries Anjali (Parvathi) as per his parents' wishes, but is shocked when she asks for a divorce immediately after. She had married Akash out of parental pressure, but is only interested in finding and living with her now-missing lover Hemanth. Akash takes the situation in his stride, working towards the divorce, which they find out takes a few months to obtain through the Indian legal system. In the meanwhile they have to live together, which is not easy since they are always fighting each other. They mellow down with time and become good friends as Akash helps Anjali find her lover Hemanth and Anjali too discovers that Akash was in love with another gal before his marriage. The climactic moment arrives when their divorce papers are finally ready and they need to sign off on their legal separation.</p>
<p><strong>Milana</strong> is a breath of fresh air in Kannada movies! The principle duo and the supporting cast have all acted well. Puneeth and Parvathi make a beautiful onscreen couple and I might catch more of their movies. The story is interesting, though the comedy baggage and the couple of fights could have easily been buried. The music by Mano Murthy and the heartwarming lyrics by Jayant Kaikini go along great together. I loved the tracks Male Ninthu Hoda Mele and Ninindale. Directed by Prakash, Milana is an endearing romantic drama in Kannada.</p>
