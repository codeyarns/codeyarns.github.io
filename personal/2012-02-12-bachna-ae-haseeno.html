<p>I watched <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachna_Ae_Haseeno"><strong>Bachna Ae Haseeno</strong></a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachna_Ae_Haseeno">बचना ऐ हसीनों</a>) recently though I have been listening to its songs for a long time now. On a trip in Switzerland (this is a Yash Chopra movie remember? ;-) ) <strong>Ranbir Kapoor</strong> makes the innocent <strong>Minissha Lamba</strong> fall in love with him, only to unceremoniously dump her after the trip. A few years later he is cohabiting with a model (<strong>Bipashu Basu</strong>). When she proposes they get married, he is unable to draw the courage to decline and finally leaves her at the altar. Later in Australia he really falls in love with a taxi driver (<strong>Deepika Padukone</strong>) but she turns him down. He then realizes the hurt he caused his former girlfriends and proceeds to win back their forgiveness.</p>
<p>The first half of the movie is fast and fun to watch. In contrast, the latter half where Ranbir revisits Lamba and Basu is slow, long, boring and pointless. The plot does not help either making no strong case for why he has to endure such hardship when his former friends have moved on with their lives. While Bipasha and Deepika are pretty enough, I liked the tender pairing of Minissha and Ranbir in the first half. The movie spans the world and the scenic backgrounds are a delight. The music is good, my favorite tracks being <strong>Khuda Jaane</strong> and <strong>Aahista Aahista</strong>. Bachna Ae Haseeno is a tad long but is a good romantic movie of Ranbir.</p>
