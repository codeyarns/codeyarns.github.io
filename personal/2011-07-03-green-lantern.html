<p>The spate of super-hero movies this year seems endless, Hollywood
studios must have gotten really desperate! Not having seen the
effectiveness of 3D in movies in quite a while, I decided to check out
the 3D version of <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Lantern_%28film%29"><strong>Green
Lantern</strong></a> at a theatre recently. The story is set in an
alternate universe involving Earth and aliens of all sorts. Planet
<strong>Oa</strong> is the home of the Green Lanterns, a regiment of
green-suit wearing aliens who guard the Universe. Their superpower is
<strong>will</strong>, which they can use to bring to life any object
which they can imagine. The villain named <strong>Parallax</strong>, a
planet-sized smoky mass shaped like a spider, preys on
<strong>fear</strong> (depicted by yellow). To interest us Earthlings to
watch the movie (or buy the comic) a new Green Lantern is chosen from
Earth, a fighter pilot named <strong>Hal Jordan</strong> (Ryan
Reynolds). As is typical in the first movie of a superhero series, Hal
has to turn into a responsible human, get used to the powers of his
green ring and then trounce the villain to prove himself to his green
peers.</p>
<p>Quite a bit of the plot takes place in outer space with weirdly
shaped aliens and lots and lots of green and yellow swirly undulations.
I did not find any of this interesting, maybe because I am not familiar
with this superhero or maybe because it is actually tedious. There is a
mad scientist (played by Peter Saarsgaard) who is the pawn of Parallax
on Earth, which he plays to maniacal aplomb. Ryan Reynolds in a
buffed-up role took some getting used to, mostly because in my mind he
still remains the carefree medical student he played in the sitcom <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Guys_and_a_Girl"><strong>Two
Guys, a Girl and a Pizza Place</strong></a>. (I love that series, too
bad it was shelved after just 2 seasons.) His love interest is Blake
Lively, a stiletto wearing fighter pilot (!), who has no use but as the
prize fought between the hero and the villain. I still remain skeptical
of the power of 3D, and the unending barrage of computer effects in this
movie did not repudiate my opinion. Green Lantern is an uninteresting
long-drawn-out yarn, whether you catch it in 3D or less.</p>
