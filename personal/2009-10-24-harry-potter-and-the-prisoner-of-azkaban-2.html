<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/4 (Alfonso creates a lush dark dream
onscreen. Easily the best Potter movie yet. Must watch!)</p>
<p>From the creative genius of Alfonso Cuarón, a virtual no-name in
blockbuster Hollywood comes <em><a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Prisoner_of_Azkaban_%28film%29">Harry
Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</a></em>, which easily trumps the
earlier 2 movies and sets the bar <em>extremely</em> high for any later
Harry Potter movie. While Chris Columbus played safe by sticking to the
book plot and creating very <em>child-safe</em> movies (which were
starting to get boring), his successor bravely breaks that trend by
delivering a lush, creatively brilliant piece. What Alfonso has created
is a dreamy tale of magic, which while placating the rabid
Potter-kid-fans, will take the adults on a spectacular ride of
enthrallment. Alfonso has left his distinctive stamp on the movie, with
its looks, feels and sounds, all distancing it from the earlier
candy-color works, like white from black. The magical locations and
creatures look more dirty, real, living and breathing. Scratch them and
they will bleed! Potter fans will notice how the locations around
Hogwarts, especially Hagrid’s home have changed for the better. They are
far more real, mysterious, creepy and thrilling. Astute movie watchers
will lick up the details added into every scene with painstaking care,
like the paintings surrounding the Fat Lady, or the luscious snow-filled
scenes in Hogsmeade. The icing on the cake is how the huge swinging
pendulum and the clockworks are weaved into the movie, showing that in
this movie/book the biggest protagonist is <em>Time</em> itself.</p>
<p>I cannot heap enough praise on Alfonso and his cinematographer
Michael Seresin for their work in this movie. Alfonso has dispensed with
the by-the-book wizard dresses of the earlier movies, and has dressed
his students in modern T-shirt, jeans and short skirts under their
robes. Harry, Ron and Hermione, all stand out here from the earlier
movies with their puberty in full blast. Especially Hermione who is
endearing with her cute perkiness. Daniel Radcliffe fails spectacularly
to act in emotional scenes, giving expressionless blank looks, but Emma
Watson (Hermione), Alan Rickman (Snape) and David Thewlis (Lupin) easily
fill that lacunae with their stylish acting. Alfonso has made several
plot changes from the book and has cut out major portions of it. Some
Potter fans might despise this, but I loved it! Who wants to sit through
2 full Quidditch matches anyway! I can go on and on about this movie.
Let me just say that this is easily the best Harry Potter movie yet!</p>
