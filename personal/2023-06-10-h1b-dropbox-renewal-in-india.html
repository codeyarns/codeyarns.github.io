<h1 class="title">H1B Dropbox Renewal in India</h1>

<p>I had to renew the H1B and H4 visas for myself and my dependents this
year in India. Our renewals qualified for the dropbox process and this
post captures notes from the entire process.</p>
<h2 id="getting-an-appointment">Getting an appointment</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>We created <a
href="https://ceac.state.gov/genniv/"><strong>DS-160 Non-immigrant Visa
Applications</strong></a> for each applicant. We chose the <em>Chennai
(India)</em> consulate since it is the closest one to our city
Bengaluru. This onerous process was somewhat easier only because we were
able to import our old DS-160 applications and use that to create the
new DS-160. At the end of this process, we get <strong>DS-160
confirmation page</strong> and the DS-160 number for each application
that are required for getting a consulate appointment.</p></li>
<li><p>We used the <a
href="https://atlas.my.salesforce-sites.com/?language=English&amp;country=India"><strong>USTravelDocs</strong></a>
website to make the appointment fee payments from an Indian bank and
schedule an appointment. During this process, the series of questions by
the wizard determined that we qualified for <em>dropbox</em> appointment
and did not need a consulate interview appointment. The dropbox process
allows submission of documents in 6 other cities in addition to the 5
cities with US Consulates. Though I planned to submit in Bengaluru
(which does not have a consulate) the website still requires getting an
appointment at a US Consulate. So I scheduled a dropbox appointment at
Chennai and the process ends with an appointment confirmation page that
lists the appointment location and time and the DS-160 numbers of the
applicants.</p></li>
<li><p>The USTravelDocs website allows rescheduling the appointment to a
different city and date up to 4 times. Since we wanted a better
appointment date that would be during our kid’s summer break, we checked
the website regularly. We were able to reschedule to a date that worked
better for us using this process.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We booked our flight tickets to India and prepared the original and
copies of documents needed for the application.</p>
<h2 id="submitting-documents-for-dropbox">Submitting documents for
dropbox</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>The dropbox seems to be outsourced to the VFS company in India.
Their office in Bengaluru was in a mall. We arrived at the location at
our designated appointment time with all the documents. We were informed
that just the principal applicant (me) is enough and my dependents were
asked to go home.</p></li>
<li><p>After going through security check, I was assigned a ticket
number and sat in a room of applicants waiting for my ticket to be
called. For my afternoon appointment, the waiting time turned out to be
about 2 hours.</p></li>
<li><p>Though I had brought in a lot of extra documents, the VFS
official only collected the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Copy of appointment confirmation.</li>
<li>DS-160 confirmation pages of all applicants.</li>
<li>Our current passports. Previous visa stamps of my spouse and mine
was in these current passports. Our son’s last visa was in an older
passport, but they didn’t take that since that is not required for an
applicant who is a minor.</li>
<li>1 US passport photo for each applicant</li>
<li>Employment verification letter from my company. This was provided to
me by our company’s immigration firm.</li>
<li>Both current and previous I-797 of principal applicant.</li>
<li>INR 650 in <em>cash</em> per applicant.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="timeline-to-getting-the-visa">Timeline to getting the visa</h2>
<p>After submitting at VFS, the status of the application can be tracked
at 2 different websites:</p>
<ul>
<li><a
href="https://atlas.my.salesforce-sites.com/?language=English&amp;country=India"><strong>USTravelDocs</strong></a>
to track the passports being sent to US Consulate and track them back
from US Consulate to my city.</li>
<li><a
href="https://ceac.state.gov/CEACStatTracker/Status.aspx"><strong>CEAC
(Consulate Electronic Application Center)</strong></a> to track progress
at the consulate.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is my timeline of progress for my application:</p>
<ul>
<li>Day 1: Submitted documents at VFS center in Bengaluru.</li>
<li>Day 2: USTravelDocs website said <em>“Your passport is being
delivered to post”</em></li>
<li>Day 4: USTravelDocs website said <em>“Your passport is still with
the US Embassy/Consulate”</em></li>
<li>Day 4: CEAC website said <em>“Application received”</em></li>
<li>Day 11: CEAC website said <em>“Approved”</em></li>
<li>Day 12: CEAC website said <em>“Issued”</em></li>
<li>Day 15: USTravelDocs website said <em>“Document Delivery
Information”</em></li>
<li>Day 16: USTravelDocs website said <em>“Passport has been received
from the consular section, and is currently being processed for
delivery”</em></li>
<li>Day 17: USTravelDocs website said <em>“Your passport is ready for
pickup”</em>. I also received email notifying me of the same.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="picking-up-passports">Picking up passports</h2>
<p>The documents required to pick up the passports from VFS are
described <a
href="https://ustraveldocs.com/in/en/retrieving-your-documents">here</a>.</p>
<p>I went to VFS center the day after I received the notification emails
and endured more than an hour of waiting time in the morning to pick up
our passports.</p>
<p>The VFS representative took these documents to give our
passports:</p>
<ul>
<li>Copy of appointment confirmation.</li>
<li>Originals of my Aadhaar card, my spouse’s Aadhaar card and son’s
birth certificate.</li>
<li>Photocopies of the above.</li>
<li>Authorization letter signed by my spouse listing her and our son’s
passport details and authorizing me to pick them up. The letter template
can be found in the above link.</li>
<li>INR 650 in cash per applicant.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, I felt that the dropbox process in my home city instead of
traveling to a US consulate city is an order of magnitude easier.
Needless to say it is less stressful since there is no interview by a
consulate officer.</p>
<h2 id="resources">Resources</h2>
<ul>
<li>H1B/H4 Dropbox Telegram Group: Was immensely useful to know when new
timeslots appeared so I could reschedule to a favorable date.</li>
<li><a href="https://visagrader.com/">Visa Grader</a>: I used this
website to track application times for my city and also contributed back
my timeline to help others.</li>
</ul>
