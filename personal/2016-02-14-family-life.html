<p>Ajay’s timeline in <strong>Family Life</strong> precedes my own by
almost a decade. And yet the retelling of his early years in Delhi felt
surprisingly similar to my own in Bangalore. The simplicity of his
revelations belies the effectiveness with which <strong>Akhil
Sharma</strong> is able to give voice to the observations of a child and
snatch the attention of his reader. I ended up finishing this novella in
two sittings.</p>
<p>This is the tale of a middle class Indian family that immigrates to
USA. It seems like every Indian-American author has to write one of
these, Jhumpa Lahiri’s <strong>The Namesake</strong> comes to mind.
Ajay, the younger of two brothers, is the narrator. His father finds a
government job in NYC and the two brothers and their mother move across
to join him. The shining star of the family is the first son Birju, who
tragically goes into a coma after a swimming accident.</p>
<p>What follows is the travails of this leaking ship of a family on
stormy seas. The parents are initially strong minded in their care of
Birju, who has essentially turned into a vegetable. But as the years
wear on and with no signs of their prodigious son waking up, the dad
ends up turning alcoholic. Ajay on the other hand slowly walks out of
the shadow of his genius brother to stand on his own. Though Birju’s
fate never turns rosy, the story of the family ends on a good note with
their other worries getting solved.</p>
<p>This is a short novel and the prose is very easy to read. Though it
follows in a long string of similar FOB tales, it does stand its ground.
The experiences of a desi family settling into US society is good. But,
what the book excels in is what its title promises. It is full of those
intimate and minute details in the behavior and interactions of our
parents, siblings, relatives and visitors that we witness while growing
up. The author could have easily cut out the numerous instances of desi
folks visiting Birju to try to cure him. And the ending is too hurried,
which is something I keep seeing in many good books. You feel like there
is a part two of this story and bam, it is over! Still those are minor
quibbles in a book that is sure to provide numerous trips to that sunny
backyard of our childhood.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/4</p>

<p><strong>Excerpts:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
I used to think that my father had been assigned to us by the
government. This was because he appeared to serve no purpose. When he
got home in the evening, all he did was sit in his chair in the living
room, drink tea, and read the paper. Often he looked angry.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
(The wealth of America kept astonishing me.) The bathroom was narrow. It
had a tub, sink, and toilet in a row along one wall. My father reached
between Birju and me to turn on the tap. Hot water came shaking and
steaming from the faucet. He stepped back and looked at us to gauge our
reaction. I had never seen hot water coming from a tap before. In India,
during winter, my mother used to get up early to heat pots of water on
the stove so we could bathe. Watching the hot water spill as if water
being hot meant nothing, as if there was an endless supply, I had the
sense of being in a fairy tale, one of those stories with a jug that is
always full of milk or a bag that never empties of food.
