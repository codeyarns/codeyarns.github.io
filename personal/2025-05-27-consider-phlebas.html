<p>How would you like to experience the scale and fun of the world of
<em>Star Wars</em> movies in a novel? <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consider_Phlebas"><strong>Consider
Phlebas</strong></a> is the first true <em>space opera</em> novel that I
read. Written by science fiction author <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iain_Banks"><strong>Iain M.
Banks</strong></a>, in this story we journey around space with a bunch
of mercenaries while the universe around them is caught up in an epic
war between the <strong>Idirans</strong> and
<strong>Culture</strong>.</p>
<p>Our protagonist is <strong>Horza</strong>, a shape-changing
<em>changer</em> on the side of the Idirans who is in pursuit of a
Culture <em>Mind</em> that is hiding on <em>Schar’s World</em>. Escaping
from <em>Perosteck Balveda</em>, a Culture spy, he hides his true
identity and joins a group of pirates led by <strong>Kraiklyn</strong>
on their ship <em>Clear Air Turbulence (CAT)</em>. The raid of this gang
on the <em>Temple of Light</em> ends up a disaster when their plasma
shots bounce off the crystal walls of the temple. To recoup his losses,
Kraiklyn decides to take part in the <em>Damage</em> card game being
held on the orbital <em>Vavatch</em> before it is destroyed by Culture.
While they are there, they decide to steal weapons from an abandoned
mega ship named <em>Olmedreca</em>. This raid turns out to be a disaster
too, killing most of the crew and Horza crashing on a remote island on
the Vavatch.</p>
<p>He is held prisoner by a cult of <em>Eaters</em> and their guru
<em>Fwi-Song</em>. Using his special powers, he escapes in the nick of
time and returns to witness Kraiklyn’s wager in the epic game of Damage.
Kraiklyn loses the game badly and during his escape Horza kills him and
takes on his shape. He rejoins the reminder of the CAT gang as their
leader and along with smart-talking drone <em>Unaha-Clasp</em> and
Balveda.</p>
<p>They blast their way out of the Culture ship <em>The Ends of
Invention</em> and set a course to Schar’s World. They discover that the
mind is hiding in the tunnels of <em>The Command System</em> of this
world. A renegade bunch of Idirans trouble them and in the final battle
Horza dies and the Mind escapes.</p>
<p>This is truly a delicious start to the <em>Culture</em> space opera
series and it is real fun to journey to new worlds in search of
adventure with a bunch of pirates. The characters are colorful, and the
new spaceships and worlds are awe-inspiring and interesting. The novel
is really strong in the first act, gets weaker in the second and fizzles
out in the long-drawn out third. The author has a great knack for
creating incredibly interesting, but unnecessary sideplots, like the
Eaters or the Damage card game. Furthermore, the reason behind the
Idirans-Culture war is all a bit vague and so are the powers of the
Mind. Though I complain, I loved the good parts and I might read the
second book in the series.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 3/5</p>
