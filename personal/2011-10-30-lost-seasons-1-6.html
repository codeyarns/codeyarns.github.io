<p>From the fecund imagination of <strong>J. J. Abrams</strong>, <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_%28TV_series%29"><strong>Lost</strong></a>
broke onto TV screens in 2004 and I was completely swept away by its
first season. The plot was built around survivors of a plane crash on an
island cut off from the world. By not revealing anything about these
people and imprisoning them on an island, the premise offered all kinds
of creative leaps in story-telling. Abrams and team exploited this very
well by writing some superb back-stories for the characters. I lost
touch with the series during Season 2, and watched from the sidelines as
it chugged through to completion in 2010. I jumped back in recently to
re-watch Lost from the beginning all the way to the end, over a period
of several weeks. Full of highs and lows, Lost offers a fantastic, but
ultimately unsatisfying ride.</p>
<p>The standard format of each Lost episode is a mix of the happenings
on the island interspersed with the past-story of a character. I found
the back-stories to be much more interesting than the island story. The
writers must have felt the same since the island story, which is
engrossing in the first few seasons, goes totally bonkers soon after.
They pull every trick possible from literature to bolster it up. Ideas
of God, redemption, sacrifice, miracles, secret organizations,
heaven-hell, alternate dimensions, time-travel, creation of life,
nothing is spared to weave the yarns. But, ultimately their creations
turn out to be grandiose and unconvincing. This is not say that Lost
should not be watched.</p>
<p>There are many memorable moments and interesting philosophies that
surface in Lost. One of my favorites was the thankless Sisyphean task of
pressing <em>The Button</em> every 108 minutes. Despite some of its weak
threads, Lost has some unforgettable actors who I had never seen before
on TV. Jack, Kate, Hugo, Sawyer, Locke and many more characters whose
faces are etched in my memory forever. Lost is a TV phenomenon that must
not be missed, at least the first 3 seasons. In the later seasons, Lost
demands such a suspension of disbelief that I was not willing to offer
to its incredulous tales.</p>
