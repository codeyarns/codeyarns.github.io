<p>I typically like to binge on a single TV series at a time, watching 1
episode each day. So, what I usually look for are older TV series that
have a lot of seasons and episodes. I am happy to say that I was well
entertained by the entire 6 seasons (2005-2010) of the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numbers_(TV_series)"><strong>Numbers</strong></a>
(<em>Numb3rs</em>) TV series on Amazon Prime.</p>
<p>In every episode, we see FBI agent Don Eppes and his team try to
solve a new crime mystery that happens in and around LA. To crack the
puzzle, his math genius brother Charles Eppes and his physicist mentor
Larry Fleinhardt ponder and apply a mathematical method or a computer
algorithm. They are also helped by Charles’ fiancee Amita and their
father Alan Eppes.</p>
<p>This was an easy series to like and watch every day. Charles would
introduce the math concept with a real world example (to explain to the
FBI agents) and it would be displayed with a visualization in every
episode. Though the math or compsci solution is tried and applied at
impossibly fast speeds, they all had a basis in truth and I never felt
that they were insulting intelligence. Especially with machine learning
and computer algorithms, I could see that all their approaches were
somewhat plausible. Not surprisingly, the show runners apparently
consulted with mathematicians on every single episode. If you are
looking for a fun crime series that does not insult your intelligence,
this is a good pick.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/5</p>
