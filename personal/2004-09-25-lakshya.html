<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 3/4 (Good watch)</p>
<p>Saw the movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0323013/">Lakshya</a> (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0323013/">लक्ष्य</a>) today. I have lost the taste for Hindi movies lately, but knowing Farhan Akhtar (Dil Chahta Hai) I had wanted to see this movie at the theater, but had missed it then. The movie is about Karan, a directionless 24 year old who has no idea what to do in life. In contrast, his girlfriend is hyperactive about becoming a reporter. His uncertainty about his life leads her to breakup with him. He finally decides to join the army. His stint at the IMA teaches him to have focus on his aim in life. He makes some great pals there, graduates, joins the army and is posted in Kargil. When Pakistan soldiers occupy the high altitude bunkers at Kargil, his old girlfriend also happens to come there to report on the events. He is left in a mission to capture the bunker for his country and prove himself.</p>
<p>The movie is mostly about Hrithik Roshan (Karan) who has acted very well. Preity Zinta is his girlfriend reporter. I got quite turned off by her <em>just-woke-from-bed</em> hairstyle in the first half. The background score is very good, so are the songs, but they disturb the pace of the movie. I loved the first half, the second half was just so-so. For once, there is no blatant glamorization of the army and it is depicted respectably. The production of the movie is slick and I liked that.</p>
