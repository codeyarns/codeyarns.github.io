<p>[ <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/fox/27dresses/">Trailer</a> ]</p>
<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 3/4 (Good movie)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0988595/">27 Dresses</a> is the sort of movie that is made exact to order for its principal character, which is Katherine Heigl in this case. Katherine, if you have trouble recalling, is the oh-so-innocent and delicate doctor Izzie in <a href="http://ashwinne.livejournal.com/336771.html">Grey's Anatomy</a>. Jane (Katherine Heigl) loves to help people with their weddings. She has been a bridesmaid for 27 of her friends' weddings. What about her own wedding? She is blindly infatuated with her boss George, who she hopes will <em>one fine day</em> realize her love. Jane's world goes topsy-turvy when her glamourous younger sister Tess visits her and catches the eye of George. Lo behold, after a few days of dating they are planning to even get married! And who should plan Tess's wedding but Jane! As Jane sinks in her sorrows, in comes Kevin (James Marsden), who works as a newspaper writer for the weddings column. Kevin loves Jane, Jane loves George and George loves Tess. The rest of the climax is predictable.</p>

<p>Okay, so I am a big fan of Grey's Anatomy and will watch any movie starring the actors from that show. I mean, can you really pass up a movie starring the pretty Katherine Heigl, that too in an Indian dress? She does not disappoint here and has acted pretty well. (But I suspect she will be forever given only such cry-baby roles in Hollywood.) Though dealing with a well worn subject, 27 Dresses is surprisingly watchable. James Marsden, who was thoroughly wasted as <em>Cyclops</em> in the X-Men movie series, is charming here. I would like to see both Katherine Heigl and James Marsden in more movies. 27 Dresses is pretty funny and romantic, check it out.</p>
