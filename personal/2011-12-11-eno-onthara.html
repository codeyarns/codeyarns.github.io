<p>After his success in Yogaraj Bhat’s whimsical movies, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganesh_%28actor%29"><strong>Ganesh</strong></a> seems to have run out of luck. None of his later movies have clicked with the audience. Another addition to this list is his 2011 romantic venture <strong>Eno Onthara</strong> (ಏನೋ ಒಂಥರಾ), a remake of the Tamil hit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kushi_%282000_film%29"><strong>Kushi</strong></a>. Ganesh and Priyamani play the prime characters, who we are told are destined to end up with each other. They become friends while acting as couriers for the love letters of their mutual friends. (One really wonders why these lovers are writing letters when they could email, chat or at least use SMS?! 😁 ) A misunderstanding emerges between them and they become spiteful of each other. As always (yawn), in the end they realize their love for each other.</p>
<p>I have not seen the original, but a slower more boring movie than this could not possibly be made! Without his trademark banter, Ganesh just cannot engage the viewer in a movie that is 2.5 hours long. Priyamani is pretty and passes muster, but she tries to ape Jyothika so much that it is creepy. The script, whether copied from the original or not, is just pathetic. All the songs are horrible, except for the melodramatic <strong>Anthara Heegeke</strong>, sung by SPB which is the reason I checked out this movie. Give this song a listen, but do not under any circumstance try to watch Eno Onthara!</p>
