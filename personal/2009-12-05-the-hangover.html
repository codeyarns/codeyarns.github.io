<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/4 (Easily the most hilarious movie of 2009!)</p>
<p><em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hangover_%28film%29">The Hangover</a></em> is easily the most hilarious movie of 2009! Doug is getting married in a couple of days. He heads off to Las Vegas with friends Phil and Stu and his brother-in-law Alan for his bachelor party. The guys have some drinks and they wake up the next day in their hotel room not remembering a single thing! Doug is found missing, there is a tiger in the bathroom, a baby in the closet, Phil is wearing a hospital bracelet and Stu is missing a tooth. The guys have 2 days to figure out what the hell happened during the night and find Doug before his wedding.</p>
<p><em>The Hangover</em> is best watched in a theater or with a bunch of friends. The movie is fast, feels authentic and the laughs never stop coming. Justin Bartha (playing Doug) is missing for most of the movie, so has almost no role to play. It is the odd chemistry between Bradley Cooper (playing Phil), Ed Helms (Stu) and Zach Galifianakis (Alan) which totally rocks this movie. The choice of background music and tracks is surprisingly good. The cinematography is far better than what you would expect in a comedy movie. The shots of Las Vegas shown during the opening credits are especially delicious. All in all, <em>The Hangover</em> is a loud fun ride not to be missed!</p>
