<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/4 (Easily the most hilarious movie of
2009!)</p>
<p><em><a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hangover_%28film%29">The
Hangover</a></em> is easily the most hilarious movie of 2009! Doug is
getting married in a couple of days. He heads off to Las Vegas with
friends Phil and Stu and his brother-in-law Alan for his bachelor party.
The guys have some drinks and they wake up the next day in their hotel
room not remembering a single thing! Doug is found missing, there is a
tiger in the bathroom, a baby in the closet, Phil is wearing a hospital
bracelet and Stu is missing a tooth. The guys have 2 days to figure out
what the hell happened during the night and find Doug before his
wedding.</p>
<p><em>The Hangover</em> is best watched in a theater or with a bunch of
friends. The movie is fast, feels authentic and the laughs never stop
coming. Justin Bartha (playing Doug) is missing for most of the movie,
so has almost no role to play. It is the odd chemistry between Bradley
Cooper (playing Phil), Ed Helms (Stu) and Zach Galifianakis (Alan) which
totally rocks this movie. The choice of background music and tracks is
surprisingly good. The cinematography is far better than what you would
expect in a comedy movie. The shots of Las Vegas shown during the
opening credits are especially delicious. All in all, <em>The
Hangover</em> is a loud fun ride not to be missed!</p>
