href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_White_Tiger_(Adiga_novel)"><strong>The
White Tiger</strong></a> is one of those books whose protagonist you
know you will never forget. <strong>Munna</strong> alias <strong>Balram
Halwai</strong> tells the story of his bloody journey, from the class of
have-nots to becoming one of the have-alls in modern India. His life
begins in the <strong>Darkness</strong>, the India of an entrenched
caste system, non-existent fundamental rights and blood sucking
landlords. Using his smarts he breaks out of the cyclical enslavement of
his family and becomes a driver for a US-returned babu in Delhi. In time
he realizes that he has only changed places and that he is still an
enslaved servant to new masters in the modern Indian city. Seeing no
natural end to this misery, he chances a brutal murder to escape the
coop and settles down to business in the outsourcing industry in
Bangalore.</p>
<p>This book is very gripping, simple in its telling, but very savage
and dark in its honest depiction of the other India. Munna’s life is
sad, horrific and intriguing at every turn. One has seen, read or heard
about the instances that bleed out from every page here. <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aravind_Adiga"><strong>Aravind
Adiga</strong></a> uses the animal kingdom to great effect in the book.
Animal metaphors abound from the title down to every character and
detail in this book. You either eat another or get eaten. Poverty,
class, corruption, inequality, everything is captured in such
depictions. The book is full of immensely quotable sections. You could
see any thing that outrages you in Indian news and pull out a quote from
the book that aptly matches it. Politics, poverty, traffic, deaths,
pollution, apathy, you name it, it is there. The White Tiger is
essentially one of the most Indian of books and a great disturbing
read.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/4</p>
<p><strong>ISBN:</strong> 9781848878082</p>
