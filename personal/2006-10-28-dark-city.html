<p><em>“How do we know that the world wasn’t created five minutes ago
complete with memories?”</em> — Bertrand Russell</p>
<p>A man wakes up in a hotel bathtub. He seems to have lost all his
memory. He doesn’t remember his own name or why he’s there. He discovers
a murdered female near his bed. What happened here? The phone in the
hotel room rings. The person at the other end asks him to run out
immediately, there are strangers out to kill him. He runs out into the
city only to discover that he is a serial killer named John Murdoch. The
police and the strangers are after him. Welcome to the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_City_(1998_film)"><strong>Dark
City</strong></a>.</p>
<p>John soon discovers that his memories aren’t what they seem to be.
There’s always something amiss about the city and its residents. He has
a recurring memory of a place by the ocean known as Shell Beach, but no
one seems to know how to get there. He soon finds out his mysterious
caller Dr. Schreber and learns some of the reality. The Earth has now
been taken over by the <em>Strangers</em>, an alien parasitic race with
psychokinetic power who had to leave their planet and chose our planet
to stay. They can create any physical artifact(s) by sheer
concentration, a technique they call <em>tuning</em>. The Strangers have
a collective memory but no individual memory. It is for this reason
they’ve not been able to live inside humans comfortably. The Strangers
have been experimenting with humans and their memories. Murdoch
discovers he is the only known human who seems to be unaffected by their
tuning. In fact he has a feeble power of tuning himself. What is this
world he’s been living in? How does he break out (if there is an
<em>outside</em>)? Is John for real or just another memory?</p>
<p>I first heard about Dark City after I watched The Matrix. Lots of
folks have called it as a big inspiration for Matrix (it was released a
year before Matrix). As I discovered, sadly this is true. The Matrix
isn’t as original as it seems to be. There are entire ideas, concepts,
dialogues and shot sequences that have been copied from here. Since this
movie is older than the Matrix, I’m all the more impressed by the vision
in the story and direction. Hats off! The Dark City has a
never-heard-before cast (all except Jennifer Connelly as Murdoch’s
wife), but they’ve done well. The noir-esque style and B-grade sci-fi
look of the movie doubles its coolness. No Matrix/pop-sci-fi fan should
miss this one!</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/4</p>
<hr />
<p>Here are some ideas that Matrix and Dark City share:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>A world whose reality is not real and whose residents aren’t real
either.</p></li>
<li><p>The world is controlled by more powerful beings.</p></li>
<li><p>The protagonist is <em>the one</em> who discovers he has the
power to defeat his aggressors.</p></li>
<li><p>The Stranger Mr. Hand is in pursuit of John. Agent Smith in
pursuit of Neo. They speak the same way too: “Missster Murdoch”
vs. “Missster Anderson”.</p></li>
<li><p>Dark City has Dr. Schreber, Matrix has Morpheus.</p></li>
<li><p>After Murdoch discovers his tuning power, he makes a knife thrown
at him freeze near his face and fall down. Neo does the same with
bullets fired at him.</p></li>
<li><p>Strangers levitate and float around in Dark City. Neo and Smith
can fly around.</p></li>
<li><p>Dark City has The Artist, Matrix has The Architect.</p></li>
</ol>
