<p>I love discovering new words when I am reading and then looking up their meanings and origins. A recent discovery was the word <em>milquetoast</em> in a <a href="https://twitter.com/QuinnyPig/status/1397702864454053893">tweet</a> about compensation at AWS:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>AWS is starting to have a steady drumbeat of departures. I’m sure its relatively milquetoast compensation isn’t a factor though.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="2021-08-23-english-dictionaries.html">COED</a> described the word as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>milquetoast</strong>: A person who is timid or submissive. Origin 1930s: from the name of a cartoon character Caspar Milquetoast, created by H. T. Webster in 1924.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Intrigued about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._T._Webster"><strong>H. T. Webster</strong></a>, I decided to check out a collection of his best work <strong>The Best of H. T. Webster: A Memorial Collection</strong> (1953) and was not disappointed at all. He was a famous American cartoonist, drawing primarily single panel cartoons for newspapers and was popular during 1920-50s. The book has a fun and interesting biographical sketch of the man by Philo Calhoun, which should not be missed.</p>
<p>Webster is most famous for his series <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspar_Milquetoast"><em>The Timid Soul</em></a> which features our wimpy hero Milquetoast. Other than this, the book covers all his other famous themes: bridge, poker, husband, wife, childhood, radio (there was no TV back then!) and many other topics. He was not really into politics, so very few political cartoons are featured.</p>
<p>I found his cartoons to be endearing, mostly centering around a slice-of-life nature. These cartoons also give a good view into life and times of people during the 1920-50s in the US. I loved his work and it has motivated me to pick up more of his collections for more easy reading and discovery about pre-WW2 USA.</p>
