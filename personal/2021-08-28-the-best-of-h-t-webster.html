<p>I love discovering new words and looking up their meaning and origin.
A recent find was the word <em>milquetoast</em> in a <a
href="https://twitter.com/QuinnyPig/status/1397702864454053893">tweet</a>
about compensation at AWS:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>AWS is starting to have a steady drumbeat of departures. I’m sure its
relatively milquetoast compensation isn’t a factor though.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="2021-08-23-english-dictionaries.html">COED</a> described the
word as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>milquetoast</strong>: A person who is timid or submissive.
Origin 1930s: from the name of a cartoon character Caspar Milquetoast,
created by H. T. Webster in 1924.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Intrigued about <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._T._Webster"><strong>H. T.
Webster</strong></a>, I decided to check out a collection of his best
work <strong>The Best of H. T. Webster: A Memorial Collection</strong>
(1953) and was not disappointed at all. He was a famous American
cartoonist, drawing primarily single panel cartoons for newspapers and
was popular during 1920-50s. The book has a fun and interesting
biographical sketch of the man by Philo Calhoun, which should not be
missed.</p>
<p>Webster is most famous for his series <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspar_Milquetoast"><em>The Timid
Soul</em></a> which features our wimpy hero Milquetoast. Other than
this, the book covers all his other famous themes: childhood, couples,
bridge, poker, radio (there was no TV back then!) and many other topics
from that era. He was not really into politics, so only a few political
cartoons are featured. He was a prolific cartoonist and there are entire
books of his cartoons based on each of the above themes.</p>
<p>I found his cartoons to be endearing, mostly centering around a
slice-of-life nature. I especially loved his cartoons that feature kids
or teenagers focused around childhood. These cartoons also gave me an
insight into the life and times of Americans during the decades before
WW2. What stood out to me was though so much has changed in a century,
so much more has remained the same. I loved Webster’s work and it has
motivated me to pick up more of his collections for a fun time.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/4</p>
