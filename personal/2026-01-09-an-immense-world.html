<p>Back in 2022, I read an <a
href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/07/light-noise-pollution-animal-sensory-impact/638446/">article
in The Atlantic</a> by <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Yong"><strong>Ed
Yong</strong></a> about the disruption to wildlife from the light
pollution created by humans. It was an excerpt from his book <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Immense_World"><strong>An Immense
World</strong></a> and the article was so fascinating that I knew I had
to read the book, which I got around to doing only now.</p>
<p>The main idea of the book is that we perceive the world through our
<strong>umwelt</strong>, a tiny slice of the outside sensory world for
which our sense organs are acutely sensitive to. Every animal has its
own unique umwelt, defined by its unique set of sense organs, so we
(humans) will never be capable of experiencing how a bee or a bird or a
whale experiences its surroundings. The book spends a chapter each on
the well known senses like smell, taste, light, color, and sound. But
what it sets apart is it also delves into sensing of pain, heat,
contact, flow, surface vibrations, echoes, electric fields and magnetic
fields which many animals can do.</p>
<p>Ed dives deep into the latest research findings in each of these many
senses, showing us an amazing diversity of organs that different animals
have developed and how they are able to perceive these complex signals
to live, eat, reproduce and survive. He supplies a seemingly endless
series of surprising facts and discoveries, far beyond anything I
previously known about. Along with the researchers he interviews, we
travel to every corner of our planet, through jungles, deserts and
oceans. As a former researcher, I am always fascinated with the clever
experiments these scientists devise to discover these findings.</p>
<p>This is a thoroughly researched, beautifully (almost poetic) written
book. Ed avoids 1 of the 2 sins I have found pop-sci books to commit,
i.e., confidently stating still-new discoveries as fact. However, he
still falls prey to the other sin of sharing every single thing he has
learnt. Sorry, I do not want a reference book of a thousand facts and
discoveries, which he ends up doing in 450 pages. It would have been a
zinger of a book at half its length, if he had focused on a select few
amazing animal abilities in each of the sensory chapters.</p>

<h2 id="excerpts">Excerpts</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Earth teems with sights and textures, sounds and vibrations, smells
and tastes, electric and magnetic fields. But every animal can only tap
into a small fraction of reality’s fullness. Each is enclosed within its
own unique sensory bubble, perceiving but a tiny sliver of an immense
world.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To sense the world, animals detect stimuli – quantities like light,
sound, or chemicals – and convert them into electrical signals, which
travel along neurons toward the brain. The cells that are responsible
for detecting stimuli are called receptors: Photoreceptors detect light,
chemoreceptors detect molecules, and mechanoreceptors detect pressure or
movement. These receptor cells are often concentrated in sense organs,
like eyes, noses, and ears. And sense organs, together with the neurons
that transmit their signals and the parts of the brain that process
those signals, are collectively called sensory systems. The visual
system, for example, includes the eyes, the photoreceptors inside them,
the optic nerve, and the visual cortex of the brain. Together, these
structures give most of us the sense of sight.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>John James Audubon, the avid naturalist and artist, was best known
for painting North America’s birds, and compiling those pieces into a
seminal ornithological tome.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Look inside the eyes of a jumping spider, a human, or any other
animal, and you’ll find light-detecting cells called photoreceptors.
They contain proteins called opsins. Every animal that sees does so with
opsins, which work by tightly embracing a partner molecule called a
chromophore, usually derived from vitamin A. The chromophore can absorb
the energy from a single photon of light. When it does, it instantly
snaps into a different shape, and its contortions force its opsin
partner to reshape itself, too. The opsin’s transformation then sets off
a chemical chain reaction that ends with an electrical signal traveling
down a neuron. This is how light is sensed.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Animals can achieve sharper vision by having smaller and more densely
packed photoreceptors. But each receptor now collects light over a
smaller area and is thus less sensitive. These qualities—sensitivity and
resolution—seesaw against each other. No eye can excel at both. An eagle
might be able to spot a far-off rabbit in broad daylight, but its acuity
plummets as the sun sets. (There are no nocturnal eagles.) Conversely,
lions and hyenas might not be able to resolve a zebra’s stripes at a
distance, but their vision is sensitive enough to hunt one at night.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It takes time for photoreceptors to react to incoming photons, and
for the electrical signals they generate to travel to the brain. In
killer flies, evolution has pushed these steps to their limits. When
Gonzalez-Bellido shows these insects an image, it takes just 6 to 9
milliseconds for their photoreceptors to send electrical signals, for
those signals to reach their brains, and for their brains to send
commands to their muscles. By contrast, it takes between 30 and 60
milliseconds for human photoreceptors to accomplish just the first of
those steps. If you looked at an image at the same moment as a killer
fly, the insect would be airborne well before a signal had even left
your retina.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Imagine looking at a light that flickers on and off. As the
flickering gets faster, there will come a point when the flashes merge
into a steady glow. This is called the critical flicker-fusion
frequency, or CFF. It’s a measure of how quickly a brain can process
visual information. For humans, in good light, the CFF is around 60
frames per second. For most flies, it’s up to 350. To its eyes, a human
movie would look like a slideshow.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Most “color-blind” people are also dichromats, because they’re
missing one of the three usual cones. They still see colors, albeit in a
narrower range.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Our experience of pain depends on a class of neurons called
nociceptors. The naked tips of these neurons pervade our skin and other
organs. They are loaded with sensors that detect harmful stimuli—intense
heat or cold, crushing pressures, acids, toxins, and chemicals released
by injuries and inflammation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A region [of the brain] called the somatosensory cortex deals with
touch. Different sections of the somatosensory cortex receive inputs
from different parts of the body, and the relative size of these
sections can hint at an animal’s major tactile organs. In humans, the
hands, lips, and genitals are most heavily represented.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>All of these creatures create and respond to vibrations that travel
along the surfaces around them, whether branch or beach. Scientists call
these substrate-borne vibrations.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Ears can have exceptional temporal resolution or exceptional pitch
sensitivity, but not both. “The auditory system that does fast stuff is
completely different from the auditory system that does frequency
stuff”.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It is no wonder that bats are so successful. They’re found on every
continent except Antarctica, and they account for one in every five
mammal species.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The strange ability of electric fish became known as active
electrolocation. The electric organ in the fish’s tail is like a small
battery. When it switches on, it creates an electric field that envelops
the animal. Current flows through the water from one end of the electric
organ to the other. Nearby conductors, like animals (whose cells are
essentially bags of salty liquid), increase the flow of that current.
Insulators, like rocks, reduce it. The fish can detect these differences
using sensory cells called electroreceptors.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Whenever lightning strikes the ground, electric charge moves upward,
so the upper atmosphere ends up with a positive charge and the planet’s
surface with a negative one. This is the atmospheric potential
gradient—a strong electric field that stretches from sky to ground. Even
on calm, sunny days, the air carries a voltage of around 100 volts for
every meter off the ground.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The geomagnetic field envelops the entire planet and guides animals
over migrations that can span continents. Magnetoreception remains the
sense that we know least about, even though its existence was confirmed
decades ago.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This is how science is meant to work. Scientists check each other’s
findings by repeating each other’s experiments, building upon what can
be replicated and debunking what cannot.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When animals move, their sense organs provide two kinds of
information. There’s exafference, signals produced by stuff happening in
the world. There’s also reafference, signals produced by an animal’s own
actions.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When an animal decides to move, its nervous system issues a motor
command – a set of neural signals that tell its muscles what to do. But
on its way to the muscles, this command is duplicated. The copy heads to
the sensory systems, which use it to simulate the consequences of the
intended movement. When the movement actually occurs, the senses have
already predicted the self-produced signals that they are about to
experience. And by comparing that prediction against reality, they can
work out which signals are actually coming from the outside world and
react to them appropriately.</p>
