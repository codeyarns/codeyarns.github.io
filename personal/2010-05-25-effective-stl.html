<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 3/4 (Recommended for the bookshelf of any STL user)</p>
<p>I find myself using STL a lot in my C++ code. I also found that I was continuously rewriting the STL code, every time I discovered subtle bugs in the way I was using it or when I found a more elegant solution to the same problem. Looking around for wisdom on STL, I picked up <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Effective-STL-Specific-Standard-Template/dp/0201749629/"><strong>Effective STL</strong></a> by Scott Meyers. Scott has authored two other books: <strong>Effective C++</strong> and <strong>More Effective C++</strong>, both of which I have found to be approachable and useful.</p>

<p>Like the other books in the Effective series, this one too has 5x chapters or <strong>items</strong>, as they are called. The topics they deal with include <strong>containers</strong>, <strong>iterators</strong>, <strong>algorithms</strong> and <strong>functors</strong>. The whole area of extending STL has been skipped and left for other books. Each item in the book is self contained with a title, introduction, examples, explanations, guidelines and sometimes even trivia. I found the book very useful, showing up mistakes in my code and also sharing a lot of idiomatic methods to write what I wanted. While reading the book, I found myself compelled to go back to my code and start polishing it immediately! Much like the other Effective books by Meyers, <strong>Effective STL</strong> too is really easy to read, understand and apply. Recommended for the bookshelf of everyone who uses STL.</p>
