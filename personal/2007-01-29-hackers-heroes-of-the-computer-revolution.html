<p>I finally finished Steven Levy’s classic <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackers:_Heroes_of_the_Computer_Revolution">Hackers:
Heroes Of The Computer Revolution</a>. This book had been on my reading
list since undergrad days! The book published in 1980s covers the early
years of hacking from 1958 to 1983. The book is divided into 4
parts:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><em>True Hackers</em>: The first known hackers at MIT AI Lab who
played with the rudimentary hardware of the time and coded on punch
cards. Includes Marvin Minsky, Greenblatt, Samson, Steve Russell, Stew
Nelson and others. Except for Minsky, I hadn’t even heard the other
names before. The significant creations of this era include the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_Ethic">Hacker Ethic</a>, Lisp,
Spacewar and LIFE.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Hardware Hackers</em>: Soon after, a hardware hacking
community started on the West Coast around the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homebrew_Computer_Club">Homebrew
Computer Club</a>. Familiar names start appearing from this period.
Steve “The Wiz” Wozniak’s brilliant hardware designs for Apple and Bill
Gates’ <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altair_BASIC">ALTAIR
BASIC</a> catch the limelight. In this period, Apple grows from a garage
venture to a multi-million dollar company which brings computing into
homes.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Game Hackers</em>: After home computers go mainstream starts
the craze of computer games. <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_On-Line">Sierra On-Line</a>
and <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Br%C3%B8derbund">Brøderbund</a> are
the main companies of this time (remember that this is way before Doom
and its progeny appeared).</p></li>
<li><p><em>The Last Of The True Hackers</em>: Mostly centers around RMS
who rues how the Hacker Ethic which started at MIT got lost in all the
commercialization of computers. Since the book was published in 1984, it
closes with this as the end of hacking. Little did the author know about
what was to follow once the Internet became accessible!</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The book is well researched and detailed. It can get a bit verbose
though. There is so much computer history I hadn’t even heard about that
it was worth reading just for that. Though the book is completely
non-fictional, the narration reads like a suspense novel, so it’s not
boring at all. Chapters 1 and 2 of the book are available under Project
Gutenberg <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/729">here</a>.
Recommended reading.</p>
