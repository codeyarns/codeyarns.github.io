<p><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Melancholy_of_Resistance"><strong>The
Melancholy of Resistance</strong></a> reminds me of the many torturous,
but pointless pursuits that people excel in to enter the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinness_World_Records">Guinness
World Records</a>. Hungarian author <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3_Krasznahorkai"><strong>Laszlo
Krasznahorkai</strong></a> takes us to a small town in cold winter.
Trash is piling up on the streets, stray cats abound and a Mrs. Plauf
has returned to her home by a much-delayed night train. In the next few
days, the town is beset by numerous lurkers from neighboring towns who
have arrived to scalp and watch a circus that has arrived in town with
the body of a giant whale. As the women’s commission head Mrs. Ezster
jockeys for power, her home-bound husband Mr. Ezster and his
simple-minded disciple Valuska try to feel out the changes in the town.
The director of the circus and a mysterious leader <em>The Prince</em>
lead the lurkers to ransack the town, and are put down by the army that
rolls in with a tank.</p>
<p>The standout feature of this book is that every single page is a
literal <em>wall of text</em>. The entire book is an endless stream of
extremely long stream-of-thought sentences, with no breaks for
paragraphs. If you look away for a moment, you cannot find your way back
easily and if you read quickly, it feels breathless. This is probably
the unique literary technique for which Lazlo got his Nobel.
Unfortunately, just this literary style was not enough to justify the
lack of any plot. The entire 300+ pages could be summarized in
<em>full</em> detail in a few pages. This is because <em>nothing</em>
really happens in the hundreds of pages, except for Mrs. Plauf’s train
journey at the start (which was somewhat interesting). The unending
river of text does not really wow you with any detail, or imagination,
and nor is there some twist or revelation at the end that makes the
torture worth it. And I do not believe there is anything to fault here
about the English translator <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Szirtes"><strong>George
Szirtes</strong></a> either since the problem with the book is not the
telling, but the lack of a tale of any consequence. This is one of those
rare books which I would strongly recommend avoiding.</p>

<h2 id="excerpts">Excerpts</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Uncomprehendingly, and with a certain degree of envious contempt, she
realized that her noisy fellow travellers—most likely coarse peasants
from the darkest nooks and corners of distant villages—were quickly
adapting themselves even to such straitened circumstances: to them it
was as if nothing unusual had happened, everywhere there was the
rustling of greaseproof paper being unwrapped and food being doled out,
corks were popping, beer-can lids were dropping to the greasy floor, and
here and there she could already hear that noise ‘so calculated to
offend all one’s finer feelings’ but, in her opinion, ‘perfectly common
among common people’ of munching and crunching; and what was more, the
party of four directly opposite her, who were among the loudest, had
already started dealing a deck of cards—till only she was left,
solitary, sitting even more stiffly among the increasingly loud human
hubbub, silent, her head determinedly turned to the window, her fur coat
protected from the seat by a sheet of newspaper, clutching her clipped
handbag to her with such terrified and resolute suspicion that she
hardly noticed the engine up ahead, its two red lights probing the
frozen darkness, drawing uncertainly out into the winter evening.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Mrs Eszter genuinely belonged to that class of people who ‘sicken
with spring and collapse in summer’, for whom enervating warmth,
incapacitating heat and the sun blazing in the sky were a source of
terror, confining her to bed with the most shocking migraine and a
strong tendency to bleed; one of that class, in other words, for whom
cold, not the glowing fireplace, is the natural medium that offers
protection from unremitting Evil, those who seem practically resurrected
once terminal frost sets in and polar winds sweep round corners, for it
is only winter that can clear their vision, cool their ungovernable
passions and reorganize that mass of loose thought dissolved in summer
sweats;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>According to her convictions, if there was a bed, a wardrobe, a lamp
and a basin, and if the roof didn’t leak in ‘the living unit’, all
possible human needs were satisfied.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>He confronted the slow tide of human affairs with a sad
incomprehension, dispassionately and without any sense of personal
involvement, for the greater part of his consciousness, the part
entirely given over to wonder, had left no room for more mundane
matters.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>They proclaimed that the period they were living in was ‘an
unfathomable hell between a treacherous future and an unmemorable
past’.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Our every moment is passed in a procession across dawns and
day’s-ends of the orbiting earth, across successive waves of winter and
summer, threading the planets and the stars.</p>
