<p><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Melancholy_of_Resistance"><strong>The
Melancholy of Resistance</strong></a> reminds me of the many torturous,
but pointless pursuits that people excel in to enter the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinness_World_Records">Guinness
World Records</a>. Hungarian author <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3_Krasznahorkai">Laszlo
Krasznahorkai</a> takes us to a small town in cold winter. Trash is
piling up on the streets, stray cats abound and a Mrs. Plauf has
returned to her home by a much-delayed night train. In the next few
days, the town is beset by numerous lurkers from neighboring towns who
have arrived to scalp and watch a circus that has arrived in town with
the body of a giant whale. As the women’s commission head Mrs. Ezster
jockeys for power, her home-bound husband Mr. Ezster and his
simple-minded disciple Valuska try to feel out the changes in the town.
The director of the circus and a mysterious leader <em>The Prince</em>
lead the lurkers to ransack the town, and are put down by the army that
rolls in with a tank.</p>
<p>The standout feature of this book is that every single page is a
literal <em>wall of text</em>. The entire book is an endless stream of
extremely long stream-of-thought sentences, with no breaks for
paragraphs. If you look away for a moment, you cannot find your way back
easily and if you read quickly, it feels breathless. This is probably
the unique literary technique for which Lazlo got his Nobel.
Unfortunately, just this literary style was not enough to justify the
lack of any plot. The entire 300+ pages could be summarized in
<em>full</em> detail in a few pages. This is because <em>nothing</em>
really happens in the hundreds of pages, except for Mrs. Plauf’s train
journey at the start (which was somewhat interesting). The unending
river of text does not really wow you with any detail, or imagination,
and nor is there some twist or revelation at the end that makes the
torture worth it. This is one of those rare books which I would strongly
recommend avoiding.</p>
