<p>Running to 600+ pages, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children_of_Time_(novel)"><strong>Children of Time</strong></a> is probably one of the longest science fiction books I have read. Written by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Tchaikovsky"><strong>Adrian Tchaikovsky</strong></a>, it certainly feels very long since the story spans an entire eon in a human quest to seed a new planet with life and find a habitable home.</p>
<p>We begin with Dr. Avrana Kern, one of the many scientists who has been assigned a candidate planet to terraform and seed with a <em>nanovirus</em> that can aid the rapid evolution of primate lifeforms to reach a human-like intelligent stage within a few generations. A <em>Non Ultra Natura (NUN)</em> rebel group that opposes human intervention in modifying the natural evolution of life carries out a massive terrorist campaign, almost destroying the entirety of scientific progress on Earth and all the terraforming activities at the candidate planets. Kern survives in an escape pod orbiting her planet, but does not realize that her nanovirus has selected spiders on the planet for advanced evolution.</p>
<p>Another eon after this, the last surviving humans of a destroyed Earth have built a massive spaceship called <em>Gilgamesh</em> to reach Kern’s planet in the hope of settling down there. Kern violently attacks Gilgamesh, forcing their commander Guyen to attempt to try terraforming a frozen moon in that solar system. That attempt fails, but they discover an ancient terraforming spaceship from which they are able to salvage and rearm in an attempt to defeat Kern and take back the planet.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, we witness how the spiders on this planet evolve rapidly in size and intelligence, creating cities and harnessing the worker ant colonies as computing devices to advance their science and technology. They start off praying to Kern’s satellite as a divine being and end up being able to communicate with it using radio. In the eventual climax, the Gilgamesh humans have an all out war with the spiders and Kern to capture the planet.</p>
<p>The author brings in a lot of detailed narrative that aids in believing that this kind of space travel, terraforming, hibernation and evolution might be possible. There are two parallel arcs of the Gilgamesh crew and the spiders’ evolution. Though his immense effort is clearly visible, I did not fully enjoy the length of the story nor was convinced by the use of spiders as the alternate intelligence and their use of ants as computing/technology. There are just too many chapters devoted to the many rebellions and power structure changes on the Gilgamesh and the evolution of spiders. This is a scifi story of immense scale in time and space, but could have been vastly improved with a limited length. There are apparently 2 more books in this series, but I will not be reading them.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 3/4</p>
