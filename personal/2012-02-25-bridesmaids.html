<p>There was an interview with <strong>Paul Feig</strong> on a recent episode of <strong>Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!</strong> He seemed genuinely funny and so I decided to watch his latest directorial venture, a chick flick called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridesmaids_%282011_film%29"><strong>Bridesmaids</strong></a>. It is a romantic comedy written by <strong>Kristen Wiig</strong>, who also plays the central character Annie in the movie. Annie is a 30-something whose life has hit bottom since her cake shop closed down. She is joyous when her best friend Lillian announces her marriage and makes Annie the maid of honour. Her happiness is short-lived when Helen, a jealous rival, emerges from Lillian's bridesmaids. As Helen and Annie duke it out for control, Lillian's marriage is heading to ruin.</p>
<p>Kristen Wiig rules all over the movie as the innocent but ill-fated Annie. She is the reason Bridesmaids really feels like her true story. There are quite a few funny pieces in the movie, but the bridesmaids doing unspeakable things at a bridalwear shop takes the cake. Bridesmaids is a fun movie to watch, especially if you are feeling down.</p>
