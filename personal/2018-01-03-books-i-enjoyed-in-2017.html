<h1 class="title">Books I enjoyed in 2017</h1>
<p class="date">üìÖ Published on: 2018-Jan-03</p>
</header>
<p>Compared to my movie watching, that tanked this year, I was able to read more in 2017 than in the previous year. The books I picked came from various sources. Some of them from friends, whose taste I now know matches mine. Some are from the <em>best</em> lists that appear at the end of the year on websites. And some are serendipitous picks, books that I came across when browsing at the library.</p>
<p>Classics are always a safe bet. You need a bit of effort in the beginning to adjust to the pace, language and story-telling style of our race from a century or two ago. But once you are set, they are pretty much guaranteed to give you a good time. Mark Twain's <a href="https://timefarer.wordpress.com/2017/03/05/the-adventures-of-tom-sawyer/"><strong>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</strong></a> was not surprisingly a great trip down childhood. It is also a great way to experience living in the US of that time and place.</p>
<p>Though I had watched a couple of movies based on John le Carre, this was the year I first read his books. Both <a href="https://timefarer.wordpress.com/2017/01/22/the-spy-who-came-in-from-the-cold/"><strong>The Spy Who Came In From The Cold</strong></a> and <a href="https://timefarer.wordpress.com/2017/12/28/call-for-the-dead/"><strong>Call for the Dead</strong></a> were engaging reads that show the actual workings of spy machinery.</p>
<p><a href="https://timefarer.wordpress.com/2017/03/19/nectar-in-a-sieve/"><strong>Nectar in a Sieve</strong></a> was a random pick that was quite an evocative story of hardship in pre-Independence India. I do not think I can read too many of such books, but once in a while is okay.</p>
<p>Kazuo Ishiguro was another new find this year. His writing turned out to have the power to transport me, a skeptic, to fantastical lands and mysteries. And what do you know, he got the Nobel for Literature just a few weeks after I quite enjoyed <a href="https://timefarer.wordpress.com/2017/09/24/the-buried-giant/"><strong>The Buried Giant</strong></a>.</p>
<p>This year I chewed through one more Space Odyssey book by Clarke. <a href="https://timefarer.wordpress.com/2017/03/26/2010-odyssey-two/"><strong>2010: Odyssey Two</strong></a> is pretty much like a movie sequel, taking similar journey and explorations as the original. But his writing and the intriguing premise keeps me hooked. A guilty pleasure.</p>
<p>I also finished the dystopian triad by reading <a href="https://timefarer.wordpress.com/2017/10/23/nineteen-eighty-four/"><strong>1984</strong></a>. Is that a collective scream of <em>finally!</em> that I hear? I was a bit doubtful that Orwell could bring anything new to what is already there in <a href="https://timefarer.wordpress.com/2006/09/24/brave-new-world/"><strong>Brave New World</strong></a> and <a href="https://timefarer.wordpress.com/2007/02/11/fahrenheit-451/"><strong>Fahrenheit 451</strong></a>. Boy was I proven wrong. The vivid descriptions and jargon of Big Brother world are excellent and the story is actually quite horrifying.</p>
<p>Another shocker was <a href="https://timefarer.wordpress.com/2017/11/26/the-white-tiger/"><strong>The White Tiger</strong></a>. This is a book that I had meant to read since Adiga won the Booker. Late to the party, but enjoyed it immensely.</p>
<p>A final book that was delectable is <a href="https://timefarer.wordpress.com/2017/10/07/masters-of-doom/"><strong>Masters of Doom</strong></a>. I have a secret craving to learn the inside workings of the tech industry. This one about John Carmack and John Romero has all the tension of a thriller and holds many lessons for the boom-bust cycle of the industry.</p>
<p>That is about half the books I read this year, the full list can be seen <a href="https://timefarer.wordpress.com/book-reviews/">here</a>. I would not recommend the rest. Some of them turned out to be overrated (like <a href="https://timefarer.wordpress.com/2017/02/19/the-catcher-in-the-rye/"><strong>The Catcher in the Rye</strong></a>), some whimpered in the final act and the rest I found to be too verbose (like <a href="https://timefarer.wordpress.com/2017/10/15/the-three-body-problem/"><strong>The Three-Body Problem</strong></a>). Verbosity is not a problem in itself, most classics are immensely verbose, but you need to offer something in return to keep the reader invested. A similar number of books I abandoned midway losing interest, including works by famous authors like Rushdie. I always have the hope, maybe false, that I will return someday to these books.</p>
<p>2017 was a good year in books, I hope I can have a similar 2018. I always have an eye out for books that I might enjoy or learn from. Please keep sharing your books on social media and writing about them on your blogs! :)</p>
