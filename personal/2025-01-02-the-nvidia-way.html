<p>Having worked with CUDA/Cg since its inception and worked at NVIDIA
for a few years now, I was pleasantly surprised to learn about the new
book <a href="https://www.taekim.com/"><strong>The NVIDIA
Way</strong></a> written by <a
href="https://www.taekim.com/"><strong>Tae Kim</strong></a> about the
company and its founder-CEO. The book traverses the growth and
innovation at NVIDIA since its founding in 1993 in 4 stages.</p>
<p><em>The Early Years (Pre-1993)</em> introduce Jensen‚Äôs chilhood and
upbringing as an Taiwanese immigrant child in the US and how those
experiences led to his strengths in later life. Work at LSI brought him
in touch with graphics hardware engineers <em>Curtis Priem</em> and
<em>Chris Malachowsky</em> at Sun. Seeing an opportunity in the gaming
chips market, they decided to quit their jobs and launch their new chip
named <em>NV1</em> and their startup as <em>NVidia</em> (a play on
<em>Invidia</em>, Latin for envy).</p>
<p>Thanks to the technical chops of Priem and the charisma of Jensen,
funding would be acquired but the young company would go through several
<em>Near-Death Experiences</em> during 1993-2003. Priem‚Äôs choice of
using quads for texture mapping in NV1 was innovative, but
OpenGL/DirectX chose triangles and sounded the death knell. The quad
strategy was also employed in the NV2 chip for Sega‚Äôs game console and
that was abandoned. It escaped being killed by <em>3dfx</em> with
engineering innovations and launched <em>Riva 128</em> which was a
success. The graphics chips space was highly crowded and the company
survived by innovating faster than its rivals.</p>
<p>During 2002-2013, the GPGPU usage of the parallel computing ability
in graphics chips was noticed and effort was put into turning the chip
into a GPU‚Äìallowing developers to program its shaders. First with Cg and
later with CUDA, the parallel programming ability was generalized and
supported by hardware. CUDA was promoted with researchers and
universities, leading to the acceleration of every conceivable computing
domain with GPUs. All of this meant that the programmable GPU was ready
to spark the DL revolution when AlexNet happened. The same kind of
foresight led to addition of lower precision FP, tensor cores and ray
tracing support.</p>
<p>A final conclusion chapter goes over the unique culture that Jensen
has evolved at NVIDIA. It was fun to see which of the internal workings
were revealed in the book - Jensen-isms (like <em>Speed of Light</em>),
Top 5 emails, how he communicates on emails or in meetings.</p>
<p>I found childhood stories of the founders, the founding and the early
years of company in the graphics chips space to be interesting and
enlightening. I have been working with Cg/CUDA/GPU since 2006 and the
GPU acceleration of DL since the days of Caffe, so I know that history
intimately and the author seems to have captured all that fairly well.
Not enough insight is provided into the role of software in DL and how
that is developed. The engineer in me was a tad disappointed to see that
non-DL technologies like Android ARM chips, Shield, Nintendo consoles,
robotics, edge inference, self-driving, Omniverse, ARM server CPU and
many others that NVIDIA worked/works on did not even get a mention. Also
missing is the use of GPUs in crypto mining and how that bust brought
NVIDIA to the brink. Descriptions of the semiconductor industry,
graphics, CUDA or deep learning in the book are good enough to
understand the context of the plot, but not enough to actually
understand the technology. Details of Jensen‚Äôs working style and company
culture are super interesting to read, but seem to be primarily derived
from its early years and interviews with early employees. This is
primarily a business book, and it is a light, easy and fast read on the
long pioneering journey of NVIDIA and Jensen.</p>
