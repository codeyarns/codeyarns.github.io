<p>Tried to break the exam stress by watching <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073486/">One Flew Over The Cuckoo’s Nest</a>. It is based on a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Flew_Over_the_Cuckoo%27s_Nest_%28novel%29">novel</a> of the same name. The movie stars Jack Nicholson as a criminal who tries to spend his prison term in a mental hospital by faking a mental illness. He soon becomes caught up with the lives of the people in his ward. The ward’s head nurse rules over them with unyielding power. He starts discovering that not all who are in the ward are really that insane. One night he really pushes the nurse’s temper by smuggling in booze and girls into the ward. Really enraged over the consequences of his action, the nurse gets him <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobotomy">lobotomised</a>, essentially making him a vegetable. In the end, his spirit is freed by one of his closest friends in the ward, who finally finds the courage to break free from the hospital. Two, not one, fly out of the cuckoo’s nest.</p>
<p>The movie won 5 Oscars, all the major ones (Best Picture, Actor, Actress, Director and Screenplay). Jack Nicholson has given (probably) his best performance. The climax is very moving. However, I felt the movie was slow and very depressing. I’m not too keen on watching this movie again.</p>
