<p>Concepts and visuals from movies such as <a
href="https://timefarer.wordpress.com/2011/12/24/ghost-in-the-shell/"><strong>Ghost
in the Shell</strong></a>, <a
href="https://timefarer.wordpress.com/2010/07/25/inception/"><strong>Inception</strong></a>,
<a
href="https://timefarer.wordpress.com/2006/10/28/dark-city/"><strong>Dark
City</strong></a> and <a
href="2006-05-09-the-thirteenth-floor.html"><strong>The Thirteenth
Floor</strong></a> kept swirling in my mind as I turned the pages of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromancer"><strong>Neuromancer</strong></a>.
Anyone who reads this 1984 sci-fi novel by <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Gibson"><strong>William
Gibson</strong></a> will have no doubt that these movies have borrowed
heavily from its ingenious inventions and plot. The futuristic story
begins in a Japan that is right out of <a
href="2007-10-22-blade-runner.html"><strong>Blade Runner</strong></a>.
(This movie was released two years <em>before</em> the novel). The
protagonist is <strong>Case</strong>, a former cyberspace hacker who is
living out his last days among the dregs of the underworld.
<strong>Cyberspace</strong> here refers to the interconnected worldwide
network which a user can navigate by donning a headset and melding their
consciousness into an online virtual reality avatar. Hackers can also
share the consciousness of another cyberspace user, if allowed. Things
start looking up for Case when a mysterious benefactor named
<strong>Armitage</strong> and his female bodyguard
<strong>Molly</strong> help regain his old powers in exchange for his
hacking services. As Case starts to finish his assigned nefarious tasks
one by one he realizes that he and his team are being guided and
controlled by an enormously powerful artificial intelligence (AI) named
<strong>Wintermute</strong>. He must figure out who Wintermute is
fighting and why. This slim novel comes loaded with acclaim. It is said
to be <em>the</em> <strong>cyberpunk</strong> novel and is credited with
introducing the word <em>cyberspace</em>. In my opinion, the entire plot
and visuals of The Matrix movies have been literally lifted from this
book. Even in 2015, the ideas and the vision in this work stand tall!
However, I felt that the storytelling itself was quite weak.</p>
<p>I loved the first part which introduces its sleazy dystopian world.
The hacking adventure that follows is lackluster. The problem is not the
plot, which is incredibly beautiful, as I discovered on reading it on
Wikipedia <em>after</em> I finished the book. The vision in Gibson’s
mind just does not materialize through his muddled descriptions and
conversations. Neuromancer is a short and quick read, filled with an
imagination that is epic and a writing that is not.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 3/4</p>

<p><strong>Excerpt:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
“The matrix has its roots in primitive arcade games,” said the
voice-over, “in early graphics programs and military experimentation
with cranial jacks.” […] “Cyberspace. A consensual hallucination
experienced daily by billions of legitimate operators, in every nation,
by children being taught mathematical concepts … A graphic
representation of data abstracted from the banks of every computer in
the human system. Unthinkable complexity. Lines of light ranged in the
nonspace of the mind, clusters and constellations of data.”
