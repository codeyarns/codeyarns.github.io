<h1 class="title">Casio GW-M5610U Watch</h1>
<p class="date">📅 2022-Jul-09 ⬩ ✍️ Ashwin Nanjappa ⬩ 🏷️ <a href='index.html#casio'>casio</a>, <a href='index.html#wristwatch'>wristwatch</a> ⬩ 📚 <a href="index.html">Archive</a></p>

<p>The <strong>Casio GW-M5610U</strong> (also called
<strong>GW-M5610U-1</strong>) is a digital G-Shock watch that charges
using sunlight and keeps precise time by syncing with atomic clock radio
calibration signals.</p>
<h2 id="search">Search</h2>
<p>I like attending work meetings on time and started looking for a
wristwatch that could maintain precision in time. To my surprise, I
discovered that all digital/quartz wristwatches deviate by a few seconds
within a month. Mechanical watches are worse (even million dollar ones)
- deviate by seconds within a day!</p>
<p>The only precise solutions turned out to be smart watches (that sync
with NTP servers over the internet) or digital watches that sync to the
atomic clock radio signals that are transmitted on most continents.
Needless to say that I preferred the radio sync - anything to avoid the
complexity of smartwatches and their poor battery performance. I <a
href="https://www.watchcrunch.com/ashwin/posts/smallest-casio-radio-time-digital-watch-11276">asked</a>
the friendly folks on <a
href="https://www.watchcrunch.com/"><strong>WatchCrunch</strong></a> for
a recommendation and the answer was <strong>GW-M5610</strong>.</p>
<p>I went to order the GW-M5610 (usually named
<strong>GW-M5610-1</strong> on sites) and found that it had been
recently <a
href="https://www.g-central.com/g-shock-5000-u-series-including-gw-5000u-1/">updated</a>
to GW-M5610U with an updated module and other features. And that is how
I ended up with this gem.</p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Case size</strong>: At 46.7 x 43.2 x 12.7 mm, this is the
just the right size and thickness for my tiny wrist.</li>
<li><strong>Weight</strong>: At 51.7 g, it feels as light as a feather,
especially when spread over its medium size.</li>
<li><strong>G-Shock Protection</strong>: Watch has <em>triple 10</em>
resistance - 10+ year battery life, 10+ bar water resistance and surive
fall of up to 10 meters.</li>
<li><strong>Multiband 6</strong>: Casio’s branding for the atomic clock
radio sync feature. It can sync with any of the 6 such radio sources on
the planet (see below).</li>
<li><strong>Tough Solar</strong>: Casio’s branding for the solar
charging technology used in their G-Shock watches.</li>
<li><strong>Water resist 20 BAR</strong>: Water resistance up to 200
meters. Essentially the watch can be used in all water scenarios except
scuba diving.</li>
<li><strong>Module 3495</strong>: This is the module used in this watch
and this is the search term to use to obtain the user manual
online.</li>
<li><strong>Time Signals</strong>: The watch supports these 6 signals:
<ul>
<li>Japan Time Calibration Signal (JJY) transmitted from 2 locations:
Fukushima and Fukuoka at 40 kHz/60 kHz.</li>
<li>Chinese Time Calibration Signal (BPC) transmitted from Shangqiu at
68.5 kHz.</li>
<li>US Time Calibration Signal (WWVB) transmitted from Fort Collins at
60 kHz.</li>
<li>UK Time Calibration Signal (MSF) transmitted from Anthorn at 60
kHz.</li>
<li>German Time Calibration Signal (DCF77) transmitted from Mainflingen
at 77.5 kHz.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="buttons">Buttons</h2>
<p>The user guide calls the 4 buttons A-D, but I will be referring to
them using their position on the watch since that is unambiguously
easier:</p>
<ul>
<li>A: Top left (TL)</li>
<li>B: Top right (TR)</li>
<li>C: Bottom left (BL)</li>
<li>D: Bottom right (BR)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="operation">Operation</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Switching modes</strong>: Keep pressing BL repeatedly to
switch between the following modes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Timekeeping</li>
<li>World time</li>
<li>Alarm</li>
<li>Stopwatch</li>
<li>Timer</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Changing settings</strong>: Be in timekeeping mode and
press-and-hold TL for 2 seconds when current city appears in the city
box. Pressing TL repeatedly will cycle through the following settings
you can modify:</p>
<ul>
<li>Home city</li>
<li>Summer time</li>
<li>Seconds</li>
<li>Hours</li>
<li>Minutes</li>
<li>Year</li>
<li>Month</li>
<li>Day</li>
<li>12/24 hour time</li>
<li>Date display format</li>
<li>Day of week language</li>
<li>Toggle tone</li>
<li>Illumination duration</li>
<li>Auto receive</li>
<li>Power saving Use the TR or BR buttons to change the individual
settings.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Solar charging</strong>: The display is surrounded by
grey solar panels. The current charge is shown by the L/M/H
(low/medium/high) bars at the bottom-right. The guide says that half an
hour of direct sunlight can keep the watch running for a month.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sync manually to atomic time calibration signal</strong>:
Keep watch in upright position, preferably outside where it is easy to
receive a radio signal. Press and hold BR until you see <em>RCVD</em>
flashing in top-left corner. It also shows the last date-time when it
had synced successfully while it is syncing. In the bottom-right it
shows L1/L2/L3 depending how weak/medium/strong the signal is. If sync
is successful, after about 10 minutes it shows <em>GET</em> in the
top-right corner - press BR to go back to normal timekeeping mode. If
sync has failed, it shows <em>ERR</em> in the top-right.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Timer</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get to the timer mode and you can see the set duration of the timer.
Pressing BR start/pause/resume the timer until it runs down to 0.</li>
<li>To set the timer, go to timer mode and keep TL pressed until the
time blinks. Press BL to switch between hour, minute and seconds. Press
TR and BR to set the value. Press TL to end the set operation.</li>
</ul></li>
