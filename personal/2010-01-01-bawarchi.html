<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 4/4 (Absolutely heartwarming and funny! Jaya
Badhuri is endearing!)</p>
<p>After years of prodding from friends I am slowly discovering the
wonderful world of <em><a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hrishikesh_Mukherjee">Hrishikesh
Mukherjee</a></em>. I saw <em><a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bawarchi">Bawarchi</a></em> (<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bawarchi">बावर्ची</a>) and was
completely mesmerized by this heartwarming and funny yarn. The movie is
set in the house of a retired postmaster where he lives with his large
joint family of 3 sons, daughter-in-laws and grandchildren. The family
members squabble a lot and do not help each other resulting in mutual
problems. The house requires a cook and no person they hire for this job
seems to capable of bearing with their bickering for more than a few
days.</p>
<p>One day, a stranger named Raghu (Rajesh Khanna) walks into this
racket house and volunteers to become their cook. They are initially
suspicious of him, but he wins them over with his genuine charm, good
humour and prodigous talent. He soon becomes like a family member,
brings an end to their tiffs and makes them experience the genuine joy
of helping each other out. But not all is what it seems, when we
discover that Raghu is a conman who has his eye on the chest of
valuables that belongs to the postmaster.</p>
<p>It is hard to watch Bawarchi without being overwhelmed by warmth and
joy. Based on a  Bengali play, Hrishikesh Mukherjee’s tightly written
script tugs at the heart strings. Freshness, good natured humour and
hidden irony are all pervasive in the movie. The songs are few and
pretty good, but the one which really stood out for me was the sad
<em>Tum Bin Jeevan Kaisa Jeevan?</em> (What kind of life is it without
you?).</p>

<p>Everyone has given stellar performances, but Rajesh Khanna outshines
as the do-all know-all cook. He gets so much into the skin of this
character that it is unimaginable to dream of anyone but him as the
<em>bawarchi</em>. Very notable for me was <em><a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaya_Badhuri">Jaya Badhuri</a></em>
as Krishna, the orphaned grandchild of the post master who is ill
treated by the family. From her very first appearance in
<em>Bawarchi</em>, I was completely blown away by her angelic demeanour
and beauty. (I have seen the older Jaya Bachchan in <em><a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabhi_Khushi_Kabhie_Gham">Kabhi
Khushi Kabhie Gham</a></em>, but this is the first time I saw her
younger self!) It may seem odd given how old this movie is, but I am now
<em>so</em> impressed with Jaya that I am eager to catch a few more of
her movies! <em>Bawarchi</em> is a highly recommended movie from the
Hrishikesh Mukherjee universe!</p>
