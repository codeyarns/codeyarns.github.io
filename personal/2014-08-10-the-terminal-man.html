<p>Though I have read most of the techno-thrillers written by <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Crichton"><strong>Michael
Crichton</strong></a>, I had no idea that he was actually a medical
doctor before he became a successful author. His medical knowledge comes
to the fore in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Terminal_Man"><strong>The
Terminal Man</strong></a>, one of this earliest novels, written way back
in 1972 after his debut with <a
href="2020-03-07-the-andromeda-strain.html"><strong>The Andromeda
Strain</strong></a>. Though aware of its age, I picked it up in a bid to
fill out the gaps left in the books of his I have read.</p>
<p>The Terminal Man looks at the dilemma of a computer controlling the
human brain. Like most of Crichton’s books, the fun is how he shows
something fascinating that might just be possible in the current day and
age, not in some sci-fi future. So, how to bring about a computer-brain
interface in 1972 and make it seem plausible? Enter <strong>psychomotor
epilepsy</strong>, a rare but real medical condition where the patient
can commit serious physical harm to those around him when he is under
epileptic shock. Benson is a computer scientist working on AI who is
implicated in many physical assaults committed while under psychomotor
epileptic shock. The neurological department at Harvard Medical Hospital
decide to try a new procedure to cure him. The epileptic shock can be
detected by using probes inserted into the brain. Similarly, the shock
can be annulled by inducing electric shocks in other regions of the
brain associated with pleasure. In an experimental surgical procedure,
Benson is hooked up with these probes connected to a simple computer
chip that detects and emits shocks. Technically, he is now a cyborg. As
always in a Crichton novel, things get interesting when the interface
between nature and machine goes haywire. The same happens here when
Benson’s brain gets drawn into a path of pleasure addiction, it starts
to induce the epileptic shock so that it can derive the kick of pleasure
back.</p>
<p>The technological premise and details of the surgical procedure and
device are very interesting in this novel. Its always fascinating to see
the complexity and mystery of the human brain. However, the immaturity
of an amateur author shows through in the characters and the plot. The
second half just turns into a Hollywood chase sequence to stop a
deranged killer whose brain is no longer under his control. The Terminal
Man is a good read for Crichton fans, but the rest can skip this for his
other novels, which are far better reads.</p>
<p>Rating: 3/4</p>
