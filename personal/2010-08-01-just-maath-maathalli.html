<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 3/4 (A bit slow and long, but saved by a
fresh script and good acting by Ramya and Sudeep)</p>
<p><a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_Math_Mathalli"><strong>Just
Maath Maathalli</strong></a> (<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_Math_Mathalli">Just ಮಾತ್
ಮಾತಲ್ಲಿ</a>) is a Kannada romantic drama directed by Sudeep, who is also
the protagonist in it. The story begins on a plane with Siddharth
(Sudeep) heading to Singapore in search of his lost lover Tanu (Ramya).
While chatting with his inquisitive co-passenger (Rajesh) he reveals his
former life as a rock star, his chance meeting with Tanu and having to
leave her due to demons of his past. On landing in Singapore, Rajesh
tries to help him search for Tanu. In the nailbiting climax, Siddharth
finally tracks her down, but is she still in love with him?</p>

<p>The cinematography is lovely and the production looks are neat in
Just Maath Maathalli. The music composed by <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raghu_Dixit"><strong>Raghu
Dixit</strong></a> has a rock flavour. However, unlike his fantastic
dark music for <strong>Psycho</strong>, all the tracks here are pretty
disappointing. The background score though is heart tugging in the
climactic scenes. Sudeep is good as usual, except when he is wearing his
stupid cap and Rajesh is charming, but quite irritating while they are
on the plane. <strong>Ramya</strong> clearly stands out with a bubbly
performance and evocative expressions. The chemistry between Ramya and
Sudeep is great, I hope to see more movies with them. The script,
written by Sudeep himself, is fresh and different, but fails in the
execution. The first half at the railway station is unbearably long,
slow and repetitive, reminding me of <strong><a
href="2006-02-07-groundhog-day.html">Groundhog Day</a></strong>.
Siddharth’s former life and the search for Tanu are excellently handled
and is edgy. The conclusion feels natural, but I have a feeling that it
may not play well with other audience members.</p>
