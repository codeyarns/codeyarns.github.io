<p>Disgusted by the thickness and weight of a typical men’s wallet in the back pocket I had switched to an extremely slim card case <a href="2012-04-14-wallet-what-wallet.html">as my wallet in Singapore</a>. After many years that case fell apart and I looked for a similar wallet in the US and settled on the <a href="https://www.slimfoldwallet.com/products/thin-wallet-micro-tyvek"><strong>SlimFold Micro Tyvek</strong></a>.</p>
<h2 id="pros">Pros</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Thinnest wallet in the world! 2mm thickness - there is no possible way any wallet can be thinner than this.</p></li>
<li><p>Almost zero weight! Literally nothing.</p></li>
<li><p>All the SlimFold wallets are made from <strong>Tyvek</strong>. This is a paper-like stiff synthetic material made by Dupont. In reality it feels like thin but metallic paper. This is an extremely strong and durable material - it has remained the same after many years.</p></li>
<li><p>The construction is solid. The stitches have held even after many years.</p></li>
<li><p>There are 2 slots outside and 2 slots hidden inside for credit cards. This is plenty for me.</p></li>
<li><p>There is also a space in the middle for currency notes.</p></li>
<li><p>Comes in fancy bright colors and patterns.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cons">Cons</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Biggest issue I have is that this Tyvek material does not have any grip on the cards. It is literally like being held between sheets of paper or thin metal - no grip! Though it was a bit snug in the beginning, after a while the cards just fall out. I have started to store the cards in the inner pockets just to avoid the chance of them falling out unnoticed.</p></li>
<li><p>The exterior color and surface fades and wrinkles like used paper after using for a few months. While a fade looks great on genuine leather, it does not look that great on Tyvek.</p></li>
<li><p>There is no design that makes this look or feel like (fake) leather.</p></li>
</ul>
