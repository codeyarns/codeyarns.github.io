<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/4 (A romantic comedy gem starring James
Stewart)</p>
<p>I had to watch <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shop_Around_the_Corner"><strong>The
Shop Around the Corner</strong></a>, after friend Haas pointed out that
it was the plot inspiration for <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You%27ve_Got_Mail"><strong>You’ve Got
Mail</strong></a>, one of my favorite romantic comedies. The original is
a real oldie, from 1940, starring <strong>James Stewart</strong> and
<strong>Margaret Sullavan</strong>. The story is set in Matuschek &amp;
Co., a shop that sells leather goods, where Kralik (James Stewart) is
head salesman and Klara (Margaret Sullavan) joins as a junior
saleswoman. From the very beginning, they have a spiteful relationship
with each other, spewing fire whenever possible. They are both in love
with an anonymous pen pal each, with whom they exchange letters using a
postbox at the post office. But, they do not know that they are writing
letters to each other. Kralik discovers this first when they decide to
meet up at a cafe. He is not able to reveal his true identity right
then, but has to play along to make himself more loveable in Klara’s
eyes so they can profess their love for each other.</p>

<p><strong>The Shop Around the Corner</strong> is a real gem, the plot
is simple and tight and the acting is excellent. Not just James Stewart,
who always delivers and Sullavan, but all the supporting cast leave
their mark on the viewer. There is good natured humour all through the
movie. The dialogues are especially endearing, with perfect English of a
time long gone now. <strong>You’ve Got Mail</strong> has paid homage to
this original in its cafe scene. The setting and dialogues of that scene
are a perfect copy of the same in this movie! <strong>The Shop Around
the Corner</strong> is a good old romantic comedy gem that should not be
missed.</p>
