<p>Saw this movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0354405/">Bas Yun
Hi</a> on TV. The story is about a bunch of 5 yuppies and is set totally
in Bangalore. Rohan is engaged and he believes in astrology. According
to his horoscope his ideal life partner would have a name that starts
with V. His friend Aditya (Purab Kohli) decides to play a prank on him
by getting his friend Veda (Nandita Das) to meet him and fall in love.
Rohan actually falls for it and soon he is smitten by Veda. She too
forgets its a prank and is totally attracted to him. Meanwhile, Rohan
discovers that the horoscope he had was not his but that of his brother.
Things further complicate when Rohan’s fiancée returns from her
travel.</p>
<p>The mood of this movie is totally offbeat and light. It actually
feels like one of those cloudy afternoons in Bangalore. All the locales
(Coffee Day outlets, parks, etc.) of the movie are in Bangalore and the
city looks really good on screen! Nandita Das looks damn natural and has
an easy role to play. What sucks in the movie is the pace. There really
is not enough story in it to fill 2 hours, resulting in an extremely
slow pace. The ending is quite predictable and disappointing. Had it
been edited to ¾-1 hour, this would’ve been a decent made-for-TV
movie.</p>
