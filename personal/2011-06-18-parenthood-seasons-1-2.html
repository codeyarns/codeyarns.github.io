<p>I have never been a fan of drama on TV, but my opinions changed on watching <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenthood_%282010_TV_series%29"><strong>Parenthood</strong></a>. This family drama has aired for two seasons starting in 2010. It is supposedly based on a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenthood">movie of the same name</a>, which I have not seen. The drama circles around the five families of the Bravermans who all end up living close to each other. The Braverman grandparents are living together, though there is a widening rift between them. Of their two sons and two daughters, their older daughter Sarah has returned to live with them with her two children after a divorce. Their eldest son Adam seems to have a picture perfect family, until he discovers his son has Asperger‚Äôs Syndrome. The strong willed daughter is Julia, whose husband is staying home looking after their daughter. And finally the wayward and confused son Crosby, who lives on a boat and is shocked to discover one day that he has a son.</p>
<p>Using this palette of human characters the creators have painted emotional and heartfelt threads that one can not but feel connected to. As you can guess, the similarities with <a href="http://moviemaathu.wordpress.com/2010/10/09/modern-family-season-1/"><strong>Modern Family</strong></a> are many, but this feels more memorable by being a good drama. The actors are excellently cast, leaving me wondering sometimes if they are family in real life too. My favorites are Amber, the rebel granddaughter and Crosby, the confused son. The story telling is great and leaves one eager to watch the next episode to see what befalls the characters next. Parenthood is a warm family drama that is sure to take you on a journey of misty eyes and laughter.</p>
