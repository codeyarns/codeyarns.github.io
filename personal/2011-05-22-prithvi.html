<p><strong><a

(<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prithvi_%282010_film%29">ಪೃಥ್ವಿ</a>)</strong>,
a 2010 Kannada movie, brings together my current favorite on-screen
pair: <strong>Puneeth Rajkumar</strong> and <strong>Parvathi
Menon</strong>. I loved their chemistry in <strong><a
href="2010-09-05-milana.html">Milana</a></strong> and was eager for
more. The illegal mining happening in Bellary district of Karnataka is
the topic of this movie. That also explains the title, <em>Prithvi</em>
is a Sanskrit word meaning <em>earth</em>. Prithvi (Puneeth) is a new
IAS officer who is posted to Bellary district soon after his marriage to
Parvathi. Dust, dryness and disease pervades Bellary. On a visit to the
district hospital that is choking with asthma patients, Prithvi
discovers that the air and water in the region is completely polluted
due to mining. Following that lead, he discovers that the mining
companies are operating in the district paying no heed to regulations of
any kind. When he tries to control the mining, he discovers how the
mining barons control all the politicians right up to the state
ministry. With sensationalistic TV channels turned onto him and his wife
expecting a baby, he finds himself between a rock and a hard place.</p>
<p>Directed by Jacob Varghese, Prithvi could not have been any more
pertinent! The Reddy brothers mining mafia that is raping Bellary and
pulling the strings of the BJP government in Karnataka right now is
depicted well. As you can expect, one IAS officer cannot end corruption
of this scale and thankfully the movie does not offer such a solution.
The script is well written, the movie is fast paced and there is not a
single boring moment. Puneeth and Parvathi have acted well, Puneeth is
really starting to show his chops in non-action roles. The music by
Manikanth Kadri is pleasing, the songs <em>Haagella Nee Nodabeda</em>,
<em>Hejjegondu</em> and <em>Ninagende Viseshaa</em> are still on my
playlist. All in all, Prithvi is an excellent movie that should not be
missed.</p>
