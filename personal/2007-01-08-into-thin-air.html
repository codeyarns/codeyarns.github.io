<p><em>“With enough determination, any bloody idiot can get up this
hill. The trick is to get back down alive.”</em>- Rob Hall, about
Everest.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Into_Thin_Air"><strong>Into
Thin Air: A Personal Account Of The Mt. Everest Disaster</strong></a>
written by mountaineer and author <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Krakauer"><strong>Jon
Krakauer</strong></a> recounts the ill-fated expeditions that conquered
Mount Everest on May 10, 1996. In a span of 72 hours, 12 lives from 4
different expeditions were lost in a storm at the peak. Jon was in one
of those guided expeditions led by Rob Hall under his venture Adventure
Consultants. Also, on the mountain at the same time was Scott Fischer
guiding for his agency Mountain Madness (a competitor for Adventure
Consultants) and a South Korean expedition. These teams were climbing
from the Southeast Ridge, the easier and more popular climbing route
which is on the Nepal side of Everest. At the same time an Indo-Tibetan
Border Force expedition was trying to summit from the harder Northeast
Ridge which is on the side of China. A spate of mistakes, inexperience,
overconfidence and <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia_%28medical%29">hypoxia</a>
induced decisions were accumulating on the climbers during their ascent
to the peak. The teams successfully reached the summit and were
descending when a storm blew in and it tipped the glass.</p>
<p>The book is fast paced, detailed and chilling to read. Mainly
focussing on Rob Hall’s and Fischer’s teams, we follow them as they
acclimatize and head to Everest through the base camp and the following
higher altitude camps. Mount Everest towers at 29,000+ feet (8,800+ m)
above sea level, an inhuman height, even in 1996 with all modern
advances. Helicopters can’t fly here (not enough lift). The air is so
thin, even experienced high altitude climbers need supplemental oxygen
to prevent hypoxia. Winds are cold enough to cause
limb-losing-frostbite. In the May of 1996, some of the best and
experienced mountaineers on the planet were on Everest and yet the
mountain consumed them all. Rob Hall had conquered Mt. Everest 3 times
before this. Fischer had conquered K2 (a peak considered tougher to
conquer than even Everest). On his team was the insanely exceptional
climber Boukreev, who had climbed 8000+ m peaks 7 times, all without
using supplemental oxygen! This account is full of tales of heroism, of
errors (mostly induced by hypoxia) which ended up taking lives and those
of exceptional rescue and survival against all odds. In addition, Jon
also provides information about the history of Everest, the various
unsuccessful attempts to conquer the peak and the brave mountaineers who
tried. The book is a very interesting, visceral, goosebumpy read, which
left me very disturbed and with a higher respect for Mount Everest,
nature and the human spirit which is ready to conquer it. A highly
recommended read.</p>

he wanted to climb Mount Everest (1922).</p>
