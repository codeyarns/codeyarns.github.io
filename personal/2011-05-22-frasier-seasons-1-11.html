<p>My first brush with <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frasier"><strong>Frasier</strong></a>
was more than a decade ago on the <strong>Star Plus</strong> TV channel.
Frasier was a staple on it, but I could never understand what was
happening and why it was supposed to be funny. After a lifetime, I am
glad I gave Frasier another chance.</p>
<p>Frasier (Kelsey Grammar) is a radio psychiatrist, who after a
separation with his wife moves to Seattle, to live with his dad and his
dog. His younger brother Niles (David Hyde Pierce), also a psychiatrist,
lives in the same city embroiled in an unhappy marriage. Completing the
family is Daphne, a physical therapist for Frasier’s dad, who lives with
them taking care of the house. The humour in the series comes from the
differences between these characters and the complexity from Frasier’s
conversations on radio. Frasier and Niles are highbrow snobs, while
their dad is a beer swilling ex-cop. Add to this the competitive streak
between the brothers, which should have died way back in high-school.
The public call in to Frasier’s radio show to get advice on their
personal problems and the show gets some real depth by linking their
troubles to the flaws in Frasier’s persona.</p>
<p>Frasier ran for a stupendous <strong>11</strong> seasons (264
episodes) and getting through Season 1 was the hardest for me. Once the
people and format become familiar, Frasier becomes as warm and
comfortable as a puppy. Though the script is nothing to write home
about, it is the fantastic acting by Kelsey Grammar and especially David
Hyde Pierce which makes this series memorable.</p>
<p>There are a few episodes which really stood out for me. <strong>Ham
Radio</strong> (Season 4) was stomach-churning hilarious! <strong>Odd
Man Out</strong> (Season 4) reminded me of the times I felt really
alone. <strong>Cranes Unplugged</strong> (Season 8 ) showed how things
like TV and busyness can hide dissent in the family, instead of bringing
it out and making everyone discuss the issues. <strong>Rooms with a
View</strong> (Season 10) was an especially poignant episode, which
reminded me of tense moments spent in hospitals with sick family
members.</p>
<p>Watching through a TV series this long feels like living a lifetime
with the characters. I am glad to say that Frasier is well worth the
time! 😊</p>
