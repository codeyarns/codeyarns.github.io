<p>Not a month goes by without news of some new futuristic venture that Elon Musk kicks off. But one of his biggest achievements is undoubtedly SpaceX, whose rockets are now regularly launching commercial satellites and taking humans to the International Space Station. How did SpaceX succeed where so many commercial rocket companies failed? In the book Liftoff, whose author Eric Berger was given access to Musk, his employees and the company, we get an insider view of the first few years of SpaceX, while they were struggling to get that first successful rocket launch. Specifically, the book intimately covers the creation of SpaceX and their first four launches of the Falcon 1 rocket. The first two launches failed, the third one got them to space and the fourth got them to orbit.</p>
<p>Elon Musk is a well known sci-fi fan and has always been vocal that humans should be space faring and should settle on Mars as a backup in case Earth is destroyed or becomes unhabitable. After convincing some experienced folks in this space to join him, he put down $100 million of his Paypal payout and created SpaceX in May 2002. Though the eventual goal was Mars, the first goal was to build a small rocket that could reach orbit and launch a small rocket and then to generate revenue based off satellite launches to become self-sustaining. And what would SpaceX do differently from all the other rocket startups that failed? Instead of the traditional way of solidifying a design, the idea was to <em>iterate</em> quickly, essentially ‚Äúmove fast and break things‚Äù.</p>
<p>The first rocket was christened Falcon 1 and it had a common design - a first-stage engine (named Merlin) to get to space and a small second-stage engine (named Kestrel) to orbit and place the payload. The folks he had hired had already designed and built these components in their former workplaces, but what was new was to design it again to fit the weight and financial budget, think innovatively on the sourcing and manufacturing and do it much more quickly than ever done before. By 2005, the rocket shell was ready, Merlin and Kestrel had been tested and a launch site at Vandenberg Air Force Base had been readied.</p>
<p>But SpaceX was forced to look for a launch site closer to the Equator and chose a small island (called Omelek) in the Kwajalein atoll where the US Army had a base. SpaceX employees used a mix of Elon‚Äôs private jet, passenger planes and sea to ship themselves and their precious cargo to Omelek and started a skunkwords project of building a launch pad there. Flight 1 of Falcon 1 failed in 2006 when the Merlin engine exploded. Later analysis showed that the cause was a fuel leak due to a nut on the fuel line not being tightened to the right torque. In 2007, they tried Flight 2 and that too failed because xxx. Flight 3 in 2008 succeeded to get to space, but the Kestrel engine failed. And finally, having worked out all these kinks, Flight 4 in 2009 was successful.</p>
<p>Messy engineering details Thinking of future ‚Äúproducts‚Äù Really modular design - same engine used in everything - Falcon 1 -&gt; 9 -? Heavy Hiring young people and working their ass off No family life, depression It is Elon‚Äôs wayy or the highway - but quick decision making Lots of support from NASA, Army, Air Force bases Lots of beauracracy in traditional rocket industry</p>
