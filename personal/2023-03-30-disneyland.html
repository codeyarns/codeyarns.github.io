<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disneyland"><strong>Disneyland</strong></a> is the first theme park created by Walt Disney and is located to the south of Los Angeles in Anaheim. We decided to drive and visit the park for a couple of days since it seemed like a fun place for our kids.</p>
<h2 id="drive">Drive</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>The route to Disneyland from Fremont consists of getting out of the SF Bay Area to Los Banos. From Los Banos to the south of Bakersfield is I-5. After that the route goes through the heart of Los Angeles and gets out to Anaheim.</p></li>
<li><p>The I-5 between Los Banos and the mountainous outskirts north of LA is a simple 2-lane straight drive. This was probably the easiest and most comfortable drive I experienced in the US until now with a fast 70 mph speed limit. The right lane is occupied by trucks, so just staying in the left lane is all that is needed.</p></li>
<li><p>The stretch through LA city during Thursday evening peak traffic was about 1.5 hours of 5-10 mph pace. It was easily the worst driving experience I had in the US until now. Thankfully, I was spared this sort of jam on Sunday morning when we headed back.</p></li>
<li><p>Depending on the LA traffic, the actual drive time might vary between 6 to 7.5 hours for this route.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="booking-and-stay">Booking and stay</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Buying tickets and making park reservations need to be done online well in advance. This can be done at: <a href="https://disneyland.disney.go.com/experience-updates/park-reservations/" class="uri">https://disneyland.disney.go.com/experience-updates/park-reservations/</a></p></li>
<li><p>Purchasing the ticket is only the act of making the payment. This does <strong>not</strong> give you entry to any park yet.</p></li>
<li><p>After purchasing the ticket, make a <strong>reservation</strong> at the park you want to visit. There are 2 theme parks at Disneyland: <strong>Disneyland Park</strong> and <strong>Disney California Adventure Park</strong>. There are options to associate each day-ticket with a particular park or hop between the parks.</p></li>
<li><p>Since the Disney California Adventure Park seemed to be catering more to adults, we decided to spend 2 entire days at the Disneyland Park.</p></li>
<li><p>The Disney site also allows you to book stay at their hotels (which are inside the park) or other hotels in Anaheim as a package. You might want to check if the package OR booking hotel yourself is a better deal.</p></li>
<li><p>There are a whole bunch of hotels that are right across the street from Disneyland and we decided to stay at one of them. This turned out to be very convenient since we could just walk into Disneyland without needing the hotel shuttle buses that are required otherwise.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="things-to-do-at-the-park">Things to do at the park</h2>
<p>All the information below is about Disneyland Park and NOT about the Disney California Adventure Park.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The park timings are 8AM to midnight. The park gets extremely crowded after around 10AM, so it is recommended to be at the gates at 7:30AM. It takes 30 minutes to get through the security bag check and the ticket scanning.</p></li>
<li><p>Installing the Disneyland app is a must for entering the park. We also used the app to check locations on map and how to walk there, wait times at the various rides, book lunch for pickup at the inside restaurants (which get super crowded at noon) and to purchase Genie+ (more on that below).</p></li>
<li><p>The park is divided into themed zones and there are rides, events, restaurants and stores in each zone. Here is what we tried:</p>
<ul>
<li>Main Street, USA
<ul>
<li>Horseless carriage, horse-drawn streetcars and omnibus: Can take a short ride on any of these. They just go round in a circle and are not meant to be transportation between the various zones.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Adventureland
<ul>
<li>Jungle Cruise: boat ride in a tropical jungle setting with the boatman making funny comments about the various funny fake animals seen along the way. Cute with kids, but not worth the 30-minute wait time.</li>
<li>Indiana Jones Adventure: indoor rollercoaster that focused more on scary lights and ghosts instead of that minecar ride. Decent, but definitely wasn‚Äôt worth the 60-minute wait time.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>New Orleans Square
<ul>
<li>Pirates of the Caribbean: indoor boat ride in the dark showing old-school animatronics and dioramas of Jack Sparrow and his cronies plundering villages. Skip.</li>
<li>Haunted Mansion: walk through a mansion filled with old-school parlor tricks. Skip.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Critter Country
<ul>
<li>Splash Mountain: iconic ride that splashes into water. Since the weather was too cold to get drenched in water, we skipped this. Need to try this next time.</li>
<li>Davy Crockett‚Äôs Explorer Canoes: Nice easy canoe ride around the water and island. Do it!</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Star Wars: Galaxy‚Äôs Edge
<ul>
<li>Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance: 60-minute wait time, but totally worth it! The best experience at this park. It is not a ride, but a whole in-movie experience as we are actually captured, taken to a Star Destroyer, are threatened by Kylo Ren and then take a ride escaping from there. We get to walk inside the ships and talked to by actors playing various Star Wars roles.</li>
<li>Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run: Worth at 30-minute, but not worth for more. 6 folks are put in the Falcon‚Äôs cockpit and need to take on pilot/gunner/engineer roles in a 3D game.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Frontierland
<ul>
<li>Pirates Lair on Tom Sawyer Island: take a raft to this island in the middle of the river. Lots of fun for kids with secret caves, pirate hideouts and bouncy briges.</li>
<li>Stage Door Cafe: decent lunch place.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Fantasyland
<ul>
<li>King Arthur Carrousel: the main carrousel in the park. Must for kids.</li>
<li>Casey Jr.¬†Circus Train: Fun for kids.</li>
<li>Dumbo the Flying Elephant: classic Disney ride. Must for kids.</li>
<li>Mad Tea Party: Classic, must for kids.</li>
<li>Alice in Wonderland: Indoor dark ride. Can be skipped.</li>
<li>Matterhorn Bobsleds: classic outdoor ride. Looked scary, so we skipped it.</li>
<li>Storybook Land Canal Boats: outdoor boat ride showing miniature settings from various fairy tales. Good one for kids!</li>
<li>It‚Äôs a Small World: indoor boat ride showing cultures from around the world. Kinda OK.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Mickey‚Äôs Toontown
<ul>
<li>Roger Rabbit‚Äôs Car Toon Spin: indoor dark ride. Skip, not worth it.</li>
<li>Chip ‚Äòn‚Äô Dale‚Äôs Gadget Coaster: fun twisty ride. Must with kids.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Tomorrowland
<ul>
<li>Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage: Good fun with kids.</li>
<li>Autopia: drive mini Honda gas cars, but stuck on a rail. Kinda OK.</li>
<li>Space Mountain: classic indoor rollercoaster. Takes a photo at the end. Must.</li>
<li>Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters: son liked it, I thought it was crap.</li>
<li>Alien Pizza Planet: good lunch options with pasta and pizza.</li>
<li>Star Tours - The Adventures Continue: 3D glasses indoor roller coaster ride. Good!</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>There is a fireworks and light show in front of the castle at 9:30PM. This got super crowded with standing-room-only on the Saturday we were there. Folks were sitting on the ground everywhere by 8:30PM. This show is a must-do.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="hollywood-sign">Hollywood sign</h2>
<ul>
<li>We decided to check out the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_Sign"><strong>Hollywood sign</strong></a> on the way home. Stopped at Lake Hollywood Park and there was roadside parking on a Sunday morning! The Hollywood sign is clearly visible from here and great for a photo before heading home.</li>
</ul>
<p>Disneyland is a great visit for kids. I was able to finally experience the many classic and memorable sights and rides from this old theme park that I had heard all my life.</p>
