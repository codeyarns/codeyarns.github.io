<p>I discovered the <a
href="https://megan473.typeform.com/to/pAG30m"><strong>Santa Clara Book
Match</strong></a> recently and decided to try it. I plugged in a few of
my favorite books and authors and a few days later HL, an actual person
from the library, emailed me three recommendations. One of them was <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annihilation_(VanderMeer_novel)"><strong>Annihilation</strong></a>
by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_VanderMeer"><strong>Jeff
Vandermeer</strong></a>. It turned out to be a slim book, supposedly the
first in the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Reach_Trilogy"><strong>Southern
Reach</strong> trilogy</a>.</p>
<p>The novel kicks off great: an expedition of four women is sent to a
mysterious and desolate coastal region named <strong>Area X</strong>.
These nameless explorers include a biologist (the narrator), an
anthropologist, a psychologist and a surveyor. They are put under
hypnosis to aid crossing over from civilization and undertake the 4 day
hike into Area X. Sent by the Southern Reach, an arm of the military,
they are the 12th expedition here, former members having been either
lost or mysteriously reappeared only to remember nothing much.</p>
<p>The explorers face a landscape devoid of humans and technology, the
last vestiges of a fishing village and lighthouse there slowly being
digested back into nature. Some <em>Event</em> has occurred here at some
time in the past and since then the environment has been changing
causing inexplicable phenomenon. And the more secrets the women
discover, it only leads them to more questions and danger.</p>
<p>I felt Annihilation had flavors of Crichton, The X Files TV series
and Night Shyamalan movies. The plot is wafer thin, but what keeps it
edge-of-seat thrilling is the writing skill of Vandermeer. I was totally
sucked into the overpoweringly dark and foreboding environment he has
created. The bleak landscape, the mysterious tower, the lighthouse, the
mysterious creatures are all truly mesmerizing. Plus there were a few
genuinely shocking moments in the story. The story lags a bit in the
middle, before picking up steam once the reveals slowly begin, the
bodies start to pile up and you start to lift the veil back along with
the narrator.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/4</p>
