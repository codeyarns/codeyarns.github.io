<p>One day about a year ago, my friend dragged me down excitedly to the
workplace cafeteria to talk about a movie he’d seen sometime back. The
movie was <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Thirteenth_Floor"><strong>The
Thirteenth Floor</strong></a> and after he revealed the story of the
movie, we animatedly discussed the possibilities of such a world. It was
uber fun. This weekend I finally caught up with the movie.</p>
<p>Fuller, a virtual reality game researcher is murdered one night. A
police detective shows up at the home of Douglas Hall to investigate.
Hall is the CEO of the company founded by Fuller. Hall has no idea why
or how Fuller was killed. But, he soon finds out that Fuller had left a
message for him before his murder <em>inside</em> the game. The game is
a full scale simulation of Los Angeles of 1937. The real kick in the
game being that the characters each have a real life and
<em>consciousness</em>. The player gets to <em>download</em> his
consciousness into any of the characters and experience their life in
real time. Hall gets inside the game and soon finds out that Fuller was
leading a life of pleasure inside the game regularly. One of the
characters in the game has discovered Fuller’s message and refuses to
reveal it to Hall. Why did Fuller have to leave a message to Hall
<em>inside</em> the game? What are the limits of any real/virtual world?
What happens when a conscious being inside a virtual game discovers his
world is not real?</p>
<p>I liked the movie. With no-name actors and not much effects, it is
almost a B-grade flick. Keep your expectations low and the movie will
turn out to be a lot of fun. It is loosely based on the sci-fi novel <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulacron-3"><strong>Simulacron-3</strong></a>.
Incidentally, this movie was released in the same year as The Matrix
which it resembles at many levels. It is quite obvious that the
Wachowski brothers borrowed some elements from this movie into
<strong>The Matrix Reloaded</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/4</p>
