<p>I recently started to use <strong>Linux</strong>, specifically the <strong>Ubuntu</strong> distribution, as my primary operating system after a hiatus of many years. Finding Ubuntu and Unity quite a different world from the my years with RedHat and SuSe, I decided to pick through <a href="http://nostarch.com/ubuntumadeeasy"><strong>Ubuntu Made Easy</strong></a> by <strong>Rickford Grant</strong> and <strong>Phil Bull</strong>. The only other contender which seemed relevant for the job was <strong>The Official Ubuntu Book</strong> (7 Ed) by Matthew Helmke.</p>
<p>Ubuntu Made Easy is just the latest in a series of introductory Linux books written by Grant. The book covers everything: installation, Unity interface, keyboard shortcuts, installing applications, all kinds of usage scenarios and even a very helpful chapter on how to get involved with the Ubuntu community. The book is hands-on, so newbies can try various projects to get familiar with the OS. The chapters on Unity, keyboard shortcuts and Ubuntu community were the most useful to me. I just flipped through the rest since either I knew it or was irrelevant to me.</p>
<p>The authors have a fun andÂ laid backÂ tone to their writing that makes the book a joy to read. There was a lot of trivia about Ubuntu that I was not aware of that made Ubuntu quite interesting in my eyes. At ~480 pages, the book is quite a tome. It is aimed at the new user and seems to get that job done well. But if you know the ropes around Linux already, I recommend picking it up at the library for a few quiet hours.</p>
