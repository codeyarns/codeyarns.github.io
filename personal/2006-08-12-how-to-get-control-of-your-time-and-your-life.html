<p>I picked up How To Get Control Of Your Time And Your Life hoping to
snatch some tips on effective time management. I started
managing/scheduling my time a couple of months ago using <a
href="http://calendar.google.com">Google Calendar</a> (before that it
was done in my mind or on scraps of paper). It is quite rudimentary, but
suits my work style well. I’m aware of the newer techniques like GTD
(which really works BTW!), but the problem with me is that I abhor these
simply because they entail extra work. I’m too lazy like that.</p>
<p>Anyway, this book is well recommended, pretty old (1973) and written
by Alan Lakein. The tone is informal. Alan talks about techniques of
managing your long term goals, short term activities and assigning
priorities. I’ve been reading the <a href="http://www.43folders.com/">43
Folders</a> blog for quite some time now and so am already aware of most
of these. There was nothing new I learnt from this book. The book is
really tiny and can be finished in a few hours. If you’re not doing any
kind of time management/scheduling, then this book will help you a lot.
But, if you’re already done with newer techniques like <a
href="http://www.davidco.com/store/catalog/Getting-Things-Done-Paperback-p-16175.php">Getting
Things Done</a>, don’t bother with this one.</p>
