<p>I got a chance to read <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_C._Clarke"><strong>Arthur C.
Clarke</strong></a>, my favorite science fiction author again, thanks to
my book club. The book chosen was <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendezvous_with_Rama"><strong>Rendezvous
with Rama</strong></a>, the first book in his <strong>Rama
series</strong>. The year is 2130 and humans have colonized Mars,
Mercury and two habitable moons of the gas giants. A new asteroid-like
body is seen moving through the solar system headed to swing around the
Sun. A mission to land on it is planned after it is found to be a
perfect spinning cylinder 50km in length and with a diameter of 16km.
And thus Captain Norton and the crew of his craft Endeavor, finds
themselves on <strong>Rama</strong>, the name given to this alien
body.</p>
<p>The book focuses mostly on the details of Rama, the author peeling
away its secrets as it is being explored. Due to the centrifugal force
from the spin of Rama, the explorers are thankful to find gravity and
surprisingly, breathable air. As Rama comes to life and lights up, it
reveals a circular sea in the middle with city-like islands, a barren
Northern part and a wild Southern part ending in ginormous spiky
mountains. Rama turns out to be like a mini-planet, albeit artificial,
with an atmosphere, hurricanes, tidal waves, a museum of artifacts and
robot-like creatures (named <strong>biots</strong>) who service the
ship. While the Rama debate rages on at the United Planets (the future
UN) and Mercury tries to sabotage the alien ship, Rama has a mind of its
own - deciding finally to swing close to the Sun to observe it, grab
some energy and leave the solar system.</p>
<p>Clarke is a master of hard science fiction and he does not disappoint
here. It is fascinating to see him explain every bit of the workings of
Rama using Newtonian physics. Unlike Hollywood movies, no detail is
glossed over, even the descent from the central hub inlets down to the
Rama’s floor involves vertical stairs at zero G and a long inclined
staircase with increasing gravity. Though published in 1973, a decade
after <a href="2014-08-31-2001-a-space-odyssey-novel.html"><strong>2001:
A Space Odyssey</strong></a>, there are no mentions of computers and AI
here. The book leaves us wondering whether Rama came to our system to
refuel from the Sun or whether it had Ramans inside or whether we were
meant to find it. There is never any real danger to the characters and I
did not find myself invested in them. So though the book is easy and
fast to read, it was pretty easy to put it down after each chapter.
Ultimately, I loved Clarke’s ability to envision novel creations in
space and to imagine our possible interactions with it.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/4</p>
