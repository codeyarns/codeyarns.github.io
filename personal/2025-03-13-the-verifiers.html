<p><strong>The Verifiers</strong> goes for that (as yet) unique
intersection of murder mystery, online dating and the Asian immigrant
experience. In this debut novel by <strong>Jane Pek</strong> we follow
the narration of protagonist <em>Claudia Lin</em>, a young New Yorker at
her first job at a dating detective agency. A what? This strange
business named <em>Veracity</em> handles investigation queries
discreetly from online daters. Their client <em>Iris Lettriste</em>
wants to know why a guy she was chatting with on a dating app suddenly
stopped talking with her. Just when Claudia is biking around town and
digging up the dirt on the mystery man, Iris is discovered dead at her
apartment. Claudia is asked to drop the case by her bosses <em>Komla
Atsina</em> and <em>Becks Rittel</em>, but she continues to pursue it
out of her own interest and discovers a much bigger conspiracy at
play.</p>
<p>The author brings to bear a deep knowledge of the dating app
technology, the harvesting and sale of customer data, how users lie
about themselves (the <em>lying limitation</em>) and the use of fake AI
bots (<em>synths</em>). What is also great is the Asian immigrant family
dynamic, which absorbs a big part of the story, though unfortunately it
has nothing to do with the plot. The author nails Claudia’s interactions
with her siblings Charlie and Caroline and especially with her
never-quite-satisfied mother. Where the novel fails is the murder
mystery itself, which is just not interesting enough. I felt like I was
plodding through intense dating company business details and Asian
family drama in the latter 2 acts, all in the pursuit of a murder which
was not meh. There are also too many references to some fictional
<em>Inspector Yuan</em> mystery series and to local NYC places, neither
of which I could care less about. And finally at the end of a drawn out
3rd act, you finally face the murderer and ask yourself “Really? This is
it?”.</p>
<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 3/5</p>
