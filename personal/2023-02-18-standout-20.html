<p>Recently, I participated in the <a
href="https://www.marcusbuckingham.com/gift-of-standout/">StandOut
strengths assessment</a> for a workshop at work. The test had several
situational questions and based on my answers the test revealed my top 2
strength roles. The reveals were pleasantly surprising and on checking
with my colleagues, the test seemed to have revealed something about me
that I myself had not realized.</p>
<p>Further interested in this test, I picked up the book
<strong>StandOut 2.0</strong> written by <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Buckingham"><strong>Marcus
Buckingham</strong></a>, the creator of this test. The basic idea of the
book is that to perform well at work, we need to know our strengths,
build on those strengths and manage around our weaknesses. This is in
contrast to how typical performance reviews identify areas of
improvement and focus on turning those into strengths.</p>
<p>The author has a lot of experience in the field of performance
management with several books like this to his name. Based on 0.5
million performance management tests on employees of various
organizations he identified 9 strength roles: advisor, connector,
creator, equalizer, influencer, pioneer, provider, stimulator and
teacher. The test was created to have questions whose answers could lead
to the discovery of top 2 such roles for a person. Every test question
is a <strong>situational judgement test (SJT)</strong> which is a
slightly-stressful situational question and our top-of-the-mind response
to it. What was interesting was that all the 4 answers for each question
were equally good. But there is also a 30 second time limit, so
essentially the test forces you to choose the answer that goes along
with your character.</p>
<p>Once you identify your top 2 roles, you can refer to the detailed
sections in the book on each of these roles. For each role, it provides
detailed description of the role, how to make an impact in the team,
improve performance, pitfalls to watch out for and how to apply the
strength in leadership/management/sales/clients.</p>
<p>Your strengths are how you come across to your colleagues. So the
identified roles can sometimes be surprising (like it was to me) that
this is how I am perceived by others. I felt the test was eye-opening
and I can definitely recommend spending the time to try this test. The
test report is quite detailed and most of the worth of the book can be
obtained in that report itself.</p>
<p>The book itself is short and easy to read, which cannot be said for
most management books. However, there is little value it adds on top of
the test report. The book also further feeds into the author’s personal
learning channel and a strengths-based performance system, neither of
which I am interested to check out at this moment.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 2/4</p>
