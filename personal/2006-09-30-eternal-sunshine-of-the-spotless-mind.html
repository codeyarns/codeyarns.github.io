<p>What if you could erase your most painful memories and start afresh? The movie <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_Sunshine_of_the_Spotless_Mind">Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind</a></strong> deals with dreams and memories. Joel (Jim Carrey) is a silent introvert who wakes up one Valentine’s Day and decides to visit Montauk. On the cold beach of Montauk he runs into Clementine (Kate Winslet), a loquacious female who lives life to the max. They are slowly attracted to each other on the train journey back. The blissful romance continues for sometime until they have a spat. Clementine has her memories of Joel <em>removed</em> after visiting Lacuna Inc, a medical service which does this. Unable to live separated from Clementine, Joel too decides to get his memories removed. What follows is a dreamy journey through Joel and Clementine’s memories. Is this the end of their love?</p>
<p>The movie is directed by Michel Gondry (whose <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0354899/">The Science Of Sleep</a> is similarly themed and is in theatres right now). The screenplay is literally out of the world (it won an Oscar for the movie). The story is non-linear, funny, full of surprise and will leave you rewinding back to understand the context. Jim Carrey has given probably his best performance, ever. He should definitely give serious roles a shot. Kate Winslet as the lively Clementine is awesome. ESOTSM is a dreamy, emotional look at our memories and is difficult to put into words. You’ve got to watch it to experience it. Not to be missed.</p>
