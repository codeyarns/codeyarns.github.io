<p>[ <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y4i7gmP6ac">Trailer</a> ]</p>
<p>I finally got around to watching <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068646/">The Godfather</a> (I've not yet read the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Godfather_%28novel%29">book</a> by Mario Puzo). Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, it follows the decade long saga of a Mafia family in NYC. Don Vito (Marlon Brando) known as The Godfather runs 1 of the 5 Mafia businesses in NYC. When a lucrative offer to support the drug business comes along he turns it down. The repercussions lead to an attempt to murder him by the other Mafia. He is mortally wounded but survives. A full scale war breaks out between the Mafia as Don recuperates and his eldest son Sonny tries to run the business. In the end, Don's last son Michael (who disliked his dad's Mafia business at the start) comes back, finishes off all the Mafia heads in a clever plot and takes helm as the new Godfather.</p>
<p>The Godfather is the <a href="http://imdb.com/chart/top">#1 movie</a> on most lists (rated by critics and public alike). Excellent direction, a tense and paced story with multiple shades and superb acting grace this movie. Al Pacino stands out with his metamorphosis from a decorated WWII captain to a Mafia leader. However, I found Marlon Brando's marbles-stuck-in-mouth dialogue delivery quite comical. There are several scenes which are memorable. The one which stood out for me is the evening conversation between Don and Michael. Don tells his youngest son that he never wanted him to take up Mafia activities, he had wished a bigger cleaner future for him, which sadly never came to bear. Frankly, I wouldn't rate this as the best movie evar, but it clearly is a great movie experience.</p>

<p>Quotes from the movie:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Each man has his own destiny.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Keep your friends close, but keep your enemies closer.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Never get angry. Never make a threat. Reason with people.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Never hate your enemies. It clouds your judgement.&quot;</p>
&quot;Luca Brasi held a gun to his head, and my father assured the bandleader, that either his signature or his brains would be on the contract.&quot;
