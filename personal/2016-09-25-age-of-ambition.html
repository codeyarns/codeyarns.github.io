millions of Chinese out of poverty is undoubtedly the greatest
achievement of the last few decades. In merely a generation, China
abandoned the disastrous ideology of Chairman Mao, became the factory of
the planet and the world’s second largest economy. The Communist Party
continues a complicated game of chess to balance the aspirations of its
people while stifling any hints of dissent, disruption to social order
or debate about democracy. What are the dreams, hopes, achievements and
failures of the generation of Chinese who have only lived in this new
age? How are Chinese citizens and their leaders coping with the tectonic
changes their nation is going through? <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Osnos"><strong>Evan
Osnos</strong></a> tries to show these points of view of the people in
his book <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Ambition"><strong>Age of
Ambition: Chasing Fortune, Truth and Faith in the New
China</strong></a>.</p>
<p>The book is based off his 8-year stint in China as a staff reporter
for <strong>The New Yorker</strong>. It is a collection of short essays
roughly divided into the three aspects of fortune, truth and faith
mentioned in the title. Each essay uses the life, dreams or travails of
a leader, activist or a citizen that Evan met in China. In the fortune
section, we see a new generation of Chinese who dream of riches and many
who achieve it. The tales of people in press and law who are constantly
censored and tormented by The Party for crossing lines are in the truth
aisle. In the final section are the Chinese looking for meaning in this
new way of life and many returning to the folds of religion.</p>
<p>Though Chinese no longer have to worry about poverty, health or
education, there is increasing inequality. Corruption in business and
politics are at astronomic levels. Though the party relentlessly censors
all signs of trouble both online and in the press, hundreds of protests
occur every day across the nation. China has moved ahead at rocket speed
and the signs of wear are showing through in incidents like the baby
milk poisoning, the Sichuan earthquake rescue or the disastrously
handled coverup of a high-speed rail accident. We see these and other
major incidents of the last few years in China through the eyes of the
people in these essays.</p>
<p>If you regularly read about China in <strong>The Economist</strong>
or <strong>The New York Times</strong>, you will be familiar with many
of the faces and stories in this book. That might bias me a bit when I
talk about this book. The first section I found to be the weakest, where
Evan drops names a lot and mixes many characters across his essays. It
gets better as the book progresses with focus on a single person or
event in each essay. The writings on the high speed rail incident and on
religion are very interesting. I especially loved the tidbits where Evan
talks about his daily life and neighbors during his stay in China.
Probably my biggest peeve with this good book is its verbiage. I have
seen this with many Western folks who write about Asia or Africa, they
try to describe every single dialog or experience they had. With some
heavy editing, this book could have been a great insight into New
China.</p>
