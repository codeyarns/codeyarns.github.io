<p>Women from 4 generations of a Native American family are the
protagonists in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Council_of_Dolls"><strong>A
Council of Dolls</strong></a>. The first narrator is a little girl
<em>Sissy</em> (aka Prunella) in 1960s Chicago. She and her
seemingly-alive doll <em>Ethel</em> watch the slow implosion of the
marriage of her calm father <em>Cornelius</em> with her firebrand mother
(also Lillian). Her mother is traumatized by her childhood forcible
separation from her family to study at Catholic boarding school.
Peppered with affairs and bouts of anger, her mother loses it after a
grocery run with Sissy and throws herself off the roof in front of her
child.</p>
<p>In the second part, we go back one generation to Lillian’s childhood
with her 2 sisters and 2 brothers. After being separated from her
parents Ina (aka Cora) and abusive Jack, she grows closer to her sister
Blanche at the boarding school. In the midst of her family’s poverty,
the rift with Blanche increases when Lillian wins an expensive doll
(<em>Mae</em>). Her joy is short lived when she decides to donate the
doll to a sick child Ada in their reservation and the doll is buried
with Ada on her demise. Returning to school, the girls are tormented and
terrorized by a Sister Francis. In the midst of the methodical cleansing
of their native language in school, Blanche loses it and dies when
Sister Francis forces her to ingest soap.</p>
<p>In the third part, we step back another generation to the childhood
of Cora (Lillian’s mom). Cora and her doll <em>Winona</em> witness the
division of her Dakota people by the creation of Indian police and the
the assassination of their leader Sitting Bull.</p>
<p>In the final part, we return to Sissy as an adult in the 2000s. She
rediscovers her childhood doll and also replicas of Mae and Winona among
her mom’s possessions. The 3 dolls share their perspective of the lives
of the 3 girls who played with them and try to bring some peace to Sissy
about her mom’s suicide.</p>
<p>Since I had recently read <a
href="2024-10-31-bad-indians.html"><strong>Bad Indians</strong></a>, I
could better empathize with the atrocious historical experiences in the
book. Beneath the calm telling burns a slow and steady anger at the loss
of the language, music, food and culture of the author’s Native American
people. The idea of using a child and her (intellectual) doll that
speaks with her is a great literary device and works well here,
especially since Native Americans did believe that many things have
spirits in them. I also liked the usage of the romanized Native American
words and script in the book. All in all, this is an engrossing, deep
and dark read by <a

<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 4/5</p>
