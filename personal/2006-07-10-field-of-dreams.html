<p><em>If you build it, he will come.</em></p>
<p>What would you do if a voice in your head asks you to build a baseball diamond in the middle of your corn fields? In the movie Field Of Dreams, Ray Kinsella is hearing a voice in his head and is faced with this dilemma. Ray is a guy with a 60s-karma-sitar-LSD hangover and a love of baseball. Leaving his work in the city, he decides to be a farmer and moves to Iowa with his family. He is not able to figure out why he should build the field, but with the support of his wife and daughter he mows out his corn crop and builds the diamond. Sure enough, <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoeless_Joe_Jackson">&quot;Shoeless Joe&quot; Jackson</a></em> and other dead players from the <em>Chicago White Sox</em> appear and start playing in his field. The players are visible to only his family members. Soon, the voice starts asking him to do other tasks. What is this voice in his head? Why must he obey it? What does it all lead to?</p>
<p>The movie is based on the book <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoeless_Joe_%28Book%29">Shoeless Joe</a> authored by W. P. Kinsella. Kevin Costner has acted well as Ray. The rural scenes of the farm are beautiful. The background music is very light and sets the pace. At first glance, the movie seems like fantasy. At a deeper level, it questions the existence of heaven, our dreams, beliefs and the need to fulfil them. The movie has an enthralling story and wraps up with an emotionally satiating ending.</p>
