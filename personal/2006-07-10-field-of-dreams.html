<p><em>If you build it, he will come.</em></p>
<p>What would you do if a voice in your head asks you to build a
baseball diamond in the middle of your corn fields? In the movie Field
Of Dreams, Ray Kinsella is hearing a voice in his head and is faced with
this dilemma. Ray is a guy with a 60s-karma-sitar-LSD hangover and a
love of baseball. Leaving his work in the city, he decides to be a
farmer and moves to Iowa with his family. He is not able to figure out
why he should build the field, but with the support of his wife and
daughter he mows out his corn crop and builds the diamond. Sure enough,
<em><a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoeless_Joe_Jackson">“Shoeless Joe”
Jackson</a></em> and other dead players from the <em>Chicago White
Sox</em> appear and start playing in his field. The players are visible
to only his family members. Soon, the voice starts asking him to do
other tasks. What is this voice in his head? Why must he obey it? What
does it all lead to?</p>
<p>The movie is based on the book <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoeless_Joe_%28Book%29">Shoeless
Joe</a> authored by W. P. Kinsella. Kevin Costner has acted well as Ray.
The rural scenes of the farm are beautiful. The background music is very
light and sets the pace. At first glance, the movie seems like fantasy.
At a deeper level, it questions the existence of heaven, our dreams,
beliefs and the need to fulfil them. The movie has an enthralling story
and wraps up with an emotionally satiating ending.</p>
