<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 1/4 (I will pay you to avoid this
torture)</p>
<p>Dear Michael Bay,</p>
<p>I know your movies are about mindless action and big explosions. Seen
from even that viewpoint your latest movie <em><a
href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1055369/">Transformers: Revenge Of The
Fallen</a></em> is a serious disappointment. The first movie
<em>Transformers</em> was such good fun, with a teenager (Shia LaBeouf)
and his hot girlfriend (Megan Fox), his car which turns into a good
robot (<em>Optimus Prime</em>) and a rival badass robot
(<em>Megatron</em>). Why did you have to tear apart such a simple
premise into shreds with this latest attempt of yours? Did you really
have to add in a complete genealogy of Transformers? Did you have to add
in so many new <em>Decepticons</em>, all virtually indistinguishable
from each other? What daydream were you floating on when you made all
the <em>Autobots</em> as GM cars? You have reached a new low with the
addition of the two new Autobot <em>Twins</em>, <em>Mudflap</em> and
<em>Skids</em>, who are illiterate, act dumb, talk like rappers and
squabble all the time. Why did you needlessly crowd the movie with tiny
Decepticons which look exactly like <em>Gremlins</em>? And the most
ridiculous Decepticon of all, the <em>Pretender</em> humanoid (Isabel
Lucas) who wants to bed Shia, is a college dominatrix with a hidden tail
and snake-like tongue! Frankly, I would like to know why you hate
historical monuments so much? Did your Transformers really need to end
up in Egypt and then proceed to smash, explode and tear apart every
single priceless monument of humans in the vicinity for an entire
hour?</p>
<p>This movie was <em>so</em> excruciating to watch. The viewer has to
endure extremely loud explosions and a mess of metal all pulping each
other to death for 2.5 hours. I felt like I lived a lifetime sitting
there! You added those countless slow-motion shots of Megan Fox running
away from explosions for obvious reasons. But, even her ample bosom and
physics defying clothes (sadly) do not make this movie any more
entertaining. In one word, this movie and every single aspect of it is
<em>absurd</em>.</p>
<p>Thanks for your time.</p>
