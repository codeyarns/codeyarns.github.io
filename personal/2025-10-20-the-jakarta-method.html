<p>It is no secret that USA meddles in the affairs of poorer non-Western
nations for its own gains, not hesitating to tear down democratically
elected leaders and propping up dictators. <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jakarta_Method"><strong>The
Jakarta Method</strong></a> delves into the horrific details of one such
meddling in the early years of independent Indonesia in the 1960s and
how the US would apply a similar method in many nations around the
world.</p>
<p>After World War 2, Sukarno and Hatta ended the 300-year colonial rule
of the Dutch and formed Indonesia in 1945. Over the next 2 decades, the
democracy would have the world‚Äôs 3rd largest Communist party (PKI)
participating in elections. Sukarno and Indonesia also played a pivotal
role in the creation of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) along with Nehru.
The CIA and the US state department were vary of the Communist rise in
East Asia and were taking an active role in curbing it. In Indonesia,
the CIA dropped bombs and provided arms to anti-communist rebels.</p>
<p>On 30 Sep 1964, there was an alleged coup attempt by a few
Communist-aligned army generals. General Suharto, allegedly helped by
US, took charge that day, had the generals killed and kicked off a mass
murder of all pro-PKI citizens. By March, Sukarno had handed over the
reins of the nation to Suharto. In these months, almost 1 million people
suspected of being pro-PKI would be killed and PKI would be ended
forever. Soon after, US businesses were allowed to enter the nation,
especially in the exploitation of natural resources. Though the coup
attempt is widely publicized in Indonesia to this day, the scale of the
following massacre is hidden. No truth commission or national
reconciliation process would ever be held in the nation about this.</p>
<p>Written by journalist <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_Bevins"><strong>Vincent
Bevins</strong></a> the book is based on the accounts of the survivors
of that massacre and de-classified State department documents. Bevins
further describes how this <em>Jakarta Method</em> of quelling Communist
forces would be applied by the CIA around the world in Brazil and South
America, in Central America and Africa. Since I have traveled in
Indonesia before, I was surprised by how this massacre is covered up in
the nation. This method continues to be employed to this day, however
only in non-Western nations, while Western European nations live freely.
I liked the fact that this book reveals the post-WW2 histories of many
nations of the world. It also showed how a majority of the world‚Äôs
population was and continues to be interested in charting their own
destiny, and not being aligned with US or Russia. A real problem with
this book though, is the extreme sympathetic brush with which the author
paints the Communist forces of Russia/China, constantly describing them
as innocent bystanders in the world geopolitics.</p>

<h2 id="excerpts">Excerpts</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The United States, a Western European settler colony in North
America, emerged from World War II as by far the most powerful state on
Earth. This was a surprise to most Americans, and to most of the
world.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Throughout the Americas, from Canada down to Argentina, European
colonization killed between fifty million and seventy million indigenous
people, around 90 percent of the native American population.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The First World consisted of the rich countries in North America,
Western Europe, Australia, and Japan, all of which had gotten wealthy
while engaging in colonialism. The ‚ÄúSecond World‚Äù was the Soviet Union
and the European territories where the Red Army had set up camp. And
then there was the ‚ÄúThird World‚Äù‚Äîeveryone else, the vast majority of the
world‚Äôs population. That term was coined in the early 1950s, and
originally, all of its connotations were positive. When the leaders of
these new nation-states took up the term, they spoke it with pride; it
contained a dream of a better future in which the world‚Äôs downtrodden
and enslaved masses would take control of their own destiny. The term
was used in the sense of the ‚ÄúThird Estate‚Äù during the French
Revolution, the revolutionary common people who would overthrow the
First and Second Estates of the monarchy and the clergy. ‚ÄúThird‚Äù did not
mean third-rate, but something more like the third and final act: the
first group of rich white countries had their crack at creating the
world, as did the second, and this was the new movement, full of energy
and potential, just waiting to be unleashed. For much of the planet, the
Third World was not just a category; it was a movement.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1948, on the island of Java, independence forces were battling an
army that had arrived from the Netherlands in the attempt to reconquer
its colonies in Southeast Asia. They had lost this vast archipelago to
the Japanese during World War II, and refused to recognize the
government set up by locals in 1945. During the war of independence,
right-leaning republican forces clashed with communists within the
revolutionary movement around the city of Madiun, East Java. The
communists were defeated, with the support of independence leader
Sukarno, and the head of the Indonesian Communist Party was killed in
what became known as the Madiun Affair. The huge nation that Sukarno
would go on to lead after the Dutch were finally expelled in 1949, now
called Indonesia, was seen as willing enough to put down communist
uprisings to be of long-term advantage of the United States.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Whatever their reasons, the United States established a reputation as
a frequent and violent intruder into the affairs of independent
nations.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But to Eisenhower, Wisner, and the Dulles brothers, Sukarno‚Äôs
behavior was no joke. For them, by now, neutralism itself was an
offense. Anyone who wasn‚Äôt actively against the Soviet Union must be
against the United States, no matter how loudly he praised Paul
Revere.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Throughout the course of the CIA‚Äôs history, this dynamic would often
be repeated. The Agency would act behind the back of the diplomats and
experts at the State Department. If the CIA was successful, the State
Department would be forced into backing the new state of affairs the
Agency had created. If the secret agents failed, they would just move
on, leaving the embarrassed diplomats to clean up the mess.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This new approach dovetailed with a growing consensus within the
United States that the military should be given more power and influence
in the Third World, even if it meant undermining democracy. In the
1950s, an academic field of study called Modernization Theory began to
gain influence in Washington. In its basic approach, Modernization
Theory replicated the Marxist formulation that societies progress
through stages; but it did so in a way that was highly influenced by the
anticommunist, liberal American milieu in which it emerged. The social
scientists who pioneered the field put forward that ‚Äútraditional,‚Äù
primitive societies would advance through a specific set of stages,
ideally arriving at a version of ‚Äúmodern‚Äù society that looked a whole
lot like the United States.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Brazil imported almost five million human beings from Africa, far
more than the United States did, and equal to almost half of all slaves
brought to the Americas. Just as in the US, enslavement in Brazil was
unimaginably cruel. In addition to the whip, stocks, and iron collars
studded with spikes to prevent escape, slave owners affixed iron masks,
which prevented the slaves from committing suicide by shoving earth into
their own mouths.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It was very clear to Francisca why Europeans were allowed to
experiment with social democracy and even communist politics, while her
country had been taken away from her forever. ‚ÄúRacism, very simply.
White Europeans are offered tolerance and sympathetic treatment, while
we are not.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The United States dropped three times the tonnage on Cambodia that
fell on Japan during World War II, atom bombs included.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To put down the freedom fighters, the Indonesian Armed Forces killed
up to 300,000 people. From 1975 to 1979, while both Gerald Ford and
Jimmy Carter sat in the White House, Washington‚Äôs closest ally in
Southeast Asia annihilated up to a third of the population of East
Timor, a higher percentage than those who died under Pol Pot in
Cambodia.</p>
</blockquote>
