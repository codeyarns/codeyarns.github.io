<p><em>“History has failed us, but no matter.”</em> begins <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pachinko_(novel)"><strong>Pachinko</strong></a>
before unraveling its inter-generational drama of a korean family who
move to Japan during pre-WW2 Japanese annexation of Korea. <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Min_Jin_Lee">Min Jin Lee’s</a>
central character through the book’s ages is <em>Sunja</em>, the only
daughter of Yangjin, who barely scrapes by running a boardinghouse for
fishermen. Sunja falls in love with <em>Koh Hansu</em>, only to realize
when she is pregnant that he has a family in Japan. A minister <em>Baek
Isak</em>, whose life is saved by Yangjin, offers marriage to Sunja to
save her dignity and moves to Japan to live with his brother
<em>Yoseb</em> and his wife <em>Khunghee</em>. Barely scraping by in
poverty, their lives are saved from the WW2 atom bombing by Hansu, who
moves them and (his son) Noa and (Baek’s son) Mozasu to a faraway farm.
As Japan rebuilds after the war, Yoseb is bedridden while Sunja and
Khunghee eke out a living selling candy on the streets and give a decent
education to the kids. Noa is a studious boy and Hansu sponsors his
university education, while Mozasu ends up in the pachinko business.
When Noa realizes Hansu (a yakuza) is his father he quits university and
goes into hiding working at another pachinko parlor. While Mozasu
succeeds in life and lifts his mom and aunt out of poverty, Noa
tragically kills himself. In the end, we witness Mozasu and his son
renewing their residentship in Japan, still not citizens after spending
a lifetime there.</p>
<p>This book was a truly engrossing read, enabling me to live through
the generations of this family and during this phase of regional
history. It is the story of Koreans in Japan, always treated as lower
class and never accepted as equals in the country they live in. They
have no home to return to either as their home country is divvied up
between the Communist and Allied powers. It is also a story of the
burdens on women of this generation, as the female characters remind us
with <em>“A woman’s lot is to suffer”</em>, quite a few times in the
book. The poverty, classes and inter-generational story are very similar
to one of my favorite Dickens book <a
href="2009-08-01-david-copperfield.html"><em>David Copperfield</em></a>.
The descriptions of the characters’ life in poverty in Korea and later
in Japan of this period are vivid in detail. The writing is beautiful
and sensitive, especially to the women, who form the backbone of the
story, while the men pass away. It is bittersweet to see that the family
is at least financially well off at the end, though never respected in
Japanese society. I am not surprised to learn that this book was made
into a TV series, this is a great read.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/5</p>

<h2 id="excerpt">Excerpt</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Etsuko had to go back to the restaurant, but she settled on the sofa
for a few minutes. When she had been a young mother there used to be
only one time in her waking hours when she’d felt a kind of peace, and
that was always after her children went to bed for the night. She longed
to see her sons as they were back then: their legs chubby and white,
their mushroom haircuts misshapen because they could never sit still at
the barber. She wished she could take back the times she had scolded her
children just because she was tired. There were so many errors. If life
allowed revisions, she would let them stay in their bath a little
longer, read them one more story before bed, and fix them another plate
of shrimp.</p>
