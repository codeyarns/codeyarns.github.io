<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 2/4 (So bad that you wish the villains swat this S.W.A.T. team!)</p>
<p>SWAT is a special police force in some US cities which are used for critical operations. The movie <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.W.A.T._%28film%29">S.W.A.T.</a> is about the SWAT team in the LAPD. When the movie starts off, Jim (Colin Farrell) and his partner Gamble are involved in saving hostages from a bank. Gamble is a loose cannon and shoots a hostage in the melee. He is kicked out of the force and Jim is demoted from S.W.A.T. Six months later, enter veteran Hondo (Samuel Jackson) who assembles a new S.W.A.T. team with Jim, LL Cool J, Michelle Rodriguez (remember Blue Crush?) and others. Now into this mix, throw in an international criminal who needs to be transported to a maximum security prison. The problem is that he has announced a reward of 100 million dollars to whoever can rescue him from the police. During the transport, the S.W.A.T. team get attacked from several groups including some of their own who are interested in the <span class="math inline">$$$</span> reward.</p>
<p>This is a crappy movie. The story leaks like a New Orleans levee. The S.W.A.T. team look like a bunch of jokers as they go about their training. None of the motives in the movie are strong enough to warrant the actions they take. By the time the movie reached its climax, I was wishing the bad guys would <em>swat</em> this S.W.A.T. team. You can do better than to watch this movie!</p>
