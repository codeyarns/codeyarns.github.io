Bones of Children’s Mouths Are Being Wrenched Apart</a> (The Atlantic):
David Engber asks why “Everybody’s being told they have a narrow jaw,
and everyone’s being given an expander?” In the choice between
<em>expansion</em> or <em>extraction</em>, the latter was what was
practiced generally, until expansion took hold in the last decade. The
secondary benefits of expansion on breathing and sleep apnea seem to be
unproven. The only proven situation where expanders help is posterior
crossbite, the article says.</p></li>

Robin Hood state is coming for the rich</a> (The Economist): In America,
the 1% paid 40% of income tax in 2022, up from 33% in 2001. The tax
burden on America’s bottom, second, third and fourth quintiles–80% of
the population–is far lower today than it was in the 1960s or
1970s.</p></li>

Trump’s schemes to juice the economy</a> (The Economist): In a paper
published in 2025, Nathaniel Hendren of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and his co-authors estimated that $1 spent improving the
IRS’s capacity to audit richer taxpayers yielded $12 in extra tax
revenue. The richest 5% of people are responsible for about half of all
unpaid taxes, estimates the Yale Budget Lab.</p></li>
