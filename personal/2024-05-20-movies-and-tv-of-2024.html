<h3 id="godzilla-1954"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godzilla_(1954_film)">Godzilla (1954)</a></h3>
<p>Saw the very first Godzilla movie after reading an <a href="https://www.economist.com/culture/2024/04/02/on-his-70th-birthday-godzilla-has-roared-back-to-relevance">Economist article</a> about the 70th anniversary of this movie franchise. There is a real story here: the finding that Godzilla is a jurassic monster that was living at the bottom of the ocean, but has been roused by hydrogen bomb testing. And the tension between the scientist to observe a new being and the rest of the people to destroy it. Though the effects were quite simple, the movie was actually pretty great. It was enjoyed both by us adults and the kids. It was available for free on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tubi">Tubi</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 3/4</p>
<h3 id="fatal-attraction"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatal_Attraction">Fatal Attraction</a></h3>
<p>A one time affair turns into a nightmare for a NYC lawyer and his family in this thriller. Michael Douglas and Glenn Close are fantastic in their roles. It is a delight to soak in the 80s fashion and the cinematography that captures their NYC and Bedford homes and the evening scenes of the city are gorgeous. Was the Honda Accord also a product placement, cause I loved its 80s design. Essentially, this is a romantic horror movie that is riveting and beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/4</p>
<h3 id="godzilla-x-kong-the-new-empire"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godzilla_x_Kong:_The_New_Empire">Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire</a></h3>
<p>Saw this on a Qatar Airways flight. Or rather, tried to watch it. There is some alternate green sunlit terra below our surface called Hollow Earth and Kong has been transplanted there. Meanwhile, Godzilla is on the surface sleeping in the Roman Colosseum like a cat and waking up to destroy any other monsters of his kind that show up. A strange disturbance in the force shakes this balance and we discover an alternate ape species, kong species, dragon like beings and (I just lost count and interest) inside Hollow Earth. So I am guessing Godzilla and Kong will unite to fight those? I completely lost interest and fell asleep in the flight. I won‚Äôt be bothered to watch this if I get a chance again. Just a Godawful splurge of money on pumping every scene with all kinds of CGI monsters, just because you can.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 1/4</p>
<h3 id="big"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_(film)">Big</a></h3>
<p>I will never forget Big, cause it was one of those memorable movies from my childhood (my high school years to be precise) that aired a lot on the Star Movies channel. How can a high school kid not love a movie where the hero is a child whose wish to become an adult who gets to kiss and make out with a pretty adult girl comes true? I was able to watch the movie in its entirety on a Qatar Airways flight and I loved every bit of it. Perfect casting, perfect acting and an almost-perfect script. There is just a slight nag at the back of the head of how the kid‚Äôs mom lived so calmly when her kid was living with a kidnapper for so long. Just ignore that feeling and the movie is a gem.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/4</p>
<h3 id="dirty-rotten-scoundrels"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirty_Rotten_Scoundrels_(film)">Dirty Rotten Scoundrels</a></h3>
<p>Michael Caine as a suave con artist and Steve Martin as a low grade one, both trying to separate rich women from their money. While Martin is definitely funny, seeing Caine work his magic is absolutely delightful. I would have watched a con movie starring just him. The two con artists battle each other for a woman and in the end the woman gets the best of them. Pure fun!</p>

<h3 id="for-a-few-dollars-more"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_a_Few_Dollars_More">For a Few Dollars More</a></h3>
<p>The 2nd Spaghetti Western in the Dollars trilogy. A pair of bounty hunters Clint Eastwood and the amazing Lee Van Cleef team up to take down the notorious Indio‚Äôs gang as he plans to loot the Bank of El Paso. Plenty of intrigue and plot twists resulting in a final shootout in a corral. Memorable music and the trademark trot into the sunset. Not as great as <a href="2011-01-29-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly.html">The Good, The Bad and The Ugly</a>, but filled with delicious Western tropes done excellently.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/4</p>
<h3 id="the-magnificent-seven"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magnificent_Seven_(2016_film)">The Magnificent Seven</a></h3>
<p>A Western remake of Akira Kurosawa‚Äôs epic <strong>Seven Samurai</strong>. The main lead is Denzel Washington, who pulls together a band of 7 men to help an innocent town to fight off an evil gold mining baron. The first 2 acts of pulling together the band and prepping the town for battle are OK, but the final battle act is very entertaining. The movie doesn‚Äôt even come close to the perfection, creativity and acting prowess in Kurosawa‚Äôs movie, but it can stand on its own as a good watch. Denzel is of course hats above the rest of the 7.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 3/4</p>
<h3 id="a-fistful-of-dollars"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Fistful_of_Dollars">A Fistful of Dollars</a></h3>
<p>This is the first movie in the Dollars Trilogy. We are introduced to Clint Eastwood, an extremely intelligent sharpshooter who arrives at the town of San Miguel where two business families have been at war with each other. The Baxters trade in alcohol and the Rojos trade in arms. The brother of the Rojos named Ramon is an exceptionally cunning fellow who even outsmarts and massacres a detachment of Mexican soldiers for their gold. Eastwood starts to cunningly pit one family against another to earn $500 on each attempt. His smart moves come to an end when he is caught by Ramon and faces death.</p>
<p>This movie is a fantastic start to the Dollars Trilogy by Sergio Leone. There is not one boring moment in this movie as the plot keeps twisting every minute and is highly unpredictable. The background score by Ennio Morricone is great, but there is no hummable tunes like in the following two movies.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/4</p>
