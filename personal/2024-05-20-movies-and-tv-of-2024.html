<h3 id="godzilla-1954"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godzilla_(1954_film)">Godzilla (1954)</a></h3>
<p>Saw the very first Godzilla movie after reading an <a href="https://www.economist.com/culture/2024/04/02/on-his-70th-birthday-godzilla-has-roared-back-to-relevance">Economist article</a> about the 70th anniversary of this movie franchise. There is a real story here: the finding that Godzilla is a jurassic monster that was living at the bottom of the ocean, but has been roused by hydrogen bomb testing. And the tension between the scientist to observe a new being and the rest of the people to destroy it. Though the effects were quite simple, the movie was actually pretty great. It was enjoyed both by us adults and the kids. It was available for free on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tubi">Tubi</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 3/4</p>

<p>A one time affair turns into a nightmare for a NYC lawyer and his family in this thriller. Michael Douglas and Glenn Close are fantastic in their roles. It is a delight to soak in the 80s fashion and the cinematography that captures their NYC and Bedford homes and the evening scenes of the city are gorgeous. Was the Honda Accord also a product placement, cause I loved its 80s design. Essentially, this is a romantic horror movie that is riveting and beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/4</p>
