<h3 id="godzilla-1954"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godzilla_(1954_film)">Godzilla (1954)</a></h3>
<p>Saw the very first Godzilla movie after reading an <a href="https://www.economist.com/culture/2024/04/02/on-his-70th-birthday-godzilla-has-roared-back-to-relevance">Economist article</a> about the 70th anniversary of this movie franchise. There is a real story here: the finding that Godzilla is a jurassic monster that was living at the bottom of the ocean, but has been roused by hydrogen bomb testing. And the tension between the scientist to observe a new being and the rest of the people to destroy it. Though the effects were quite simple, the movie was actually pretty great. It was enjoyed both by us adults and the kids. It was available for free on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tubi">Tubi</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 3/4</p>
<h3 id="fatal-attraction"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatal_Attraction">Fatal Attraction</a></h3>
<p>A one time affair turns into a nightmare for a NYC lawyer and his family in this thriller. Michael Douglas and Glenn Close are fantastic in their roles. It is a delight to soak in the 80s fashion and the cinematography that captures their NYC and Bedford homes and the evening scenes of the city are gorgeous. Was the Honda Accord also a product placement, cause I loved its 80s design. Essentially, this is a romantic horror movie that is riveting and beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/4</p>
<h3 id="godzilla-x-kong-the-new-empire"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godzilla_x_Kong:_The_New_Empire">Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire</a></h3>
<p>Saw this on a Qatar Airways flight. Or rather, tried to watch it. There is some alternate green sunlit terra below our surface called Hollow Earth and Kong has been transplanted there. Meanwhile, Godzilla is on the surface sleeping in the Roman Colosseum like a cat and waking up to destroy any other monsters of his kind that show up. A strange disturbance in the force shakes this balance and we discover an alternate ape species, kong species, dragon like beings and (I just lost count and interest) inside Hollow Earth. So I am guessing Godzilla and Kong will unite to fight those? I completely lost interest and fell asleep in the flight. I won’t be bothered to watch this if I get a chance again. Just a Godawful splurge of money on pumping every scene with all kinds of CGI monsters, just because you can.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 1/4</p>
<h3 id="big">Big</h3>
<p>I will never forget Big, cause it was one of those memorable movies from my childhood (my high school years to be precise) that aired a lot on the Star Movies channel. How can a high school kid not love a movie where the hero is a child whose wish to become an adult who gets to kiss and make out with a pretty adult girl comes true? I was able to watch the movie in its entirety on a Qatar Airways flight and I loved every bit of it. Perfect casting, perfect acting and an almost-perfect script. There is just a slight nag at the back of the head of how the kid’s mom lived so calmly when her kid was living with a kidnapper for so long. Just ignore that feeling and the movie is a gem.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/4</p>
