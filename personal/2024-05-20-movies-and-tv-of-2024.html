<h3 id="godzilla-1954"><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godzilla_(1954_film)">Godzilla
(1954)</a></h3>
<p>Saw the very first Godzilla movie after reading an <a
href="https://www.economist.com/culture/2024/04/02/on-his-70th-birthday-godzilla-has-roared-back-to-relevance">Economist
article</a> about the 70th anniversary of this movie franchise. There is
a real story here: the finding that Godzilla is a jurassic monster that
was living at the bottom of the ocean, but has been roused by hydrogen
bomb testing. And the tension between the scientist to observe a new
being and the rest of the people to destroy it. Though the effects were
quite simple, the movie was actually pretty great. It was enjoyed both
by us adults and the kids. It was available for free on <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tubi">Tubi</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/5</p>
<h3 id="fatal-attraction"><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatal_Attraction">Fatal
Attraction</a></h3>
<p>A one time affair turns into a nightmare for a NYC lawyer and his
family in this thriller. Michael Douglas and Glenn Close are fantastic
in their roles. It is a delight to soak in the 80s fashion and the
cinematography that captures their NYC and Bedford homes and the evening
scenes of the city are gorgeous. Was the Honda Accord also a product
placement, cause I loved its 80s design. Essentially, this is a romantic
horror movie that is riveting and beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 5/5</p>
<h3 id="godzilla-x-kong-the-new-empire"><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godzilla_x_Kong:_The_New_Empire">Godzilla
x Kong: The New Empire</a></h3>
<p>Saw this on a Qatar Airways flight. Or rather, tried to watch it.
There is some alternate green sunlit terra below our surface called
Hollow Earth and Kong has been transplanted there. Meanwhile, Godzilla
is on the surface sleeping in the Roman Colosseum like a cat and waking
up to destroy any other monsters of his kind that show up. A strange
disturbance in the force shakes this balance and we discover an
alternate ape species, kong species, dragon like beings and (I just lost
count and interest) inside Hollow Earth. So I am guessing Godzilla and
Kong will unite to fight those? I completely lost interest and fell
asleep in the flight. I won‚Äôt be bothered to watch this if I get a
chance again. Just a Godawful splurge of money on pumping every scene
with all kinds of CGI monsters, just because you can.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 1/5</p>
<h3 id="big"><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_(film)">Big</a></h3>
<p>I will never forget Big, cause it was one of those memorable movies
from my childhood (my high school years to be precise) that aired a lot
on the Star Movies channel. How can a high school kid not love a movie
where the hero is a child whose wish to become an adult who gets to kiss
and make out with a pretty adult girl comes true? I was able to watch
the movie in its entirety on a Qatar Airways flight and I loved every
bit of it. Perfect casting, perfect acting and an almost-perfect script.
There is just a slight nag at the back of the head of how the kid‚Äôs mom
lived so calmly when her kid was living with a kidnapper for so long.
Just ignore that feeling and the movie is a gem.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 5/5</p>
<h3 id="dirty-rotten-scoundrels"><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirty_Rotten_Scoundrels_(film)">Dirty
Rotten Scoundrels</a></h3>
<p>Michael Caine as a suave con artist and Steve Martin as a low grade
one, both trying to separate rich women from their money. While Martin
is definitely funny, seeing Caine work his magic is absolutely
delightful. I would have watched a con movie starring just him. The two
con artists battle each other for a woman and in the end the woman gets
the best of them. Pure fun!</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 5/5</p>
<h3 id="for-a-few-dollars-more"><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_a_Few_Dollars_More">For a Few
Dollars More</a></h3>
<p>The 2nd Spaghetti Western in the Dollars trilogy. A pair of bounty
hunters Clint Eastwood and the amazing Lee Van Cleef team up to take
down the notorious Indio‚Äôs gang as he plans to loot the Bank of El Paso.
Plenty of intrigue and plot twists resulting in a final shootout in a
corral. Memorable music and the trademark trot into the sunset. Not as
great as <a href="2011-01-29-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly.html">The
Good, The Bad and The Ugly</a>, but filled with delicious Western tropes
done excellently.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 5/5</p>
<h3 id="the-magnificent-seven"><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magnificent_Seven_(2016_film)">The
Magnificent Seven</a></h3>
<p>A Western remake of Akira Kurosawa‚Äôs epic <strong>Seven
Samurai</strong>. The main lead is Denzel Washington, who pulls together
a band of 7 men to help an innocent town to fight off an evil gold
mining baron. The first 2 acts of pulling together the band and prepping
the town for battle are OK, but the final battle act is very
entertaining. The movie doesn‚Äôt even come close to the perfection,
creativity and acting prowess in Kurosawa‚Äôs movie, but it can stand on
its own as a good watch. Denzel is of course hats above the rest of the
7.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 3/5</p>
<h3 id="a-fistful-of-dollars"><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Fistful_of_Dollars">A Fistful of
Dollars</a></h3>
<p>This is the first movie in the Dollars Trilogy. We are introduced to
Clint Eastwood, an extremely intelligent sharpshooter who arrives at the
town of San Miguel where two business families have been at war with
each other. The Baxters trade in alcohol and the Rojos trade in arms.
The brother of the Rojos named Ramon is an exceptionally cunning fellow
who even outsmarts and massacres a detachment of Mexican soldiers for
their gold. Eastwood starts to cunningly pit one family against another
to earn $500 on each attempt. His smart moves come to an end when he is
caught by Ramon and faces death.</p>
<p>This movie is a fantastic start to the Dollars Trilogy by Sergio
Leone. There is not one boring moment in this movie as the plot keeps
twisting every minute and is highly unpredictable. The background score
by Ennio Morricone is great, but there is no hummable tunes like in the
following two movies.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 5/5</p>
<h3 id="like-father-like-son"><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Like_Father,_Like_Son_(2013_film)">Like
Father, Like Son</a></h3>
<p>Yet another poignant family gem from Hirokazu Koreeda. 2 couples who
have 5 year old sons are told by their hospital that the kids had got
swapped at birth. Thoughtful drama that looks at the difference in class
between the two fathers and families and how they navigate the minefield
of swapping back their kids. It is 2 hours long, but feels much longer.
I saw it in 2 sittings, and it is perfect that way. Stellar writing,
photography, casting and acting. Nobody makes family and parenthood
movies like this guy.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 5/5</p>
<h3 id="no-country-for-old-men"><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Country_for_Old_Men">No Country
for Old Men</a></h3>
<p>Based on a novel by Cormac McCarthy, this is another gem by the Coen
Brothers. Feels like a Fargo set in dry and desolate Texas in the 80s. A
hunter who discovers drug money, being pursued by a ruthless murderer
and investigated by an old cop who is about to retire. Writing, setting,
acting, photography, all stellar. Riveting from the start to finish.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 5/5</p>
<h3 id="beverly-hills-cop"><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beverly_Hills_Cop">Beverly Hills
Cop</a></h3>
<p>Imagine my delight in discovering that this is the movie that had the
<em>Axel F</em> track which I used to listen to a lot back when I first
got Winamp! This is a good old 1980s crime comedy with Eddie Murphy as
the Detroit detective investigating his friend‚Äôs murder out west in
Beverly Hills. Aged pretty well actually, since I enjoyed its
lightheartedness from start to finish. Watched it streaming on Pluto
TV.</p>
<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 4/5</p>
<h3 id="beverly-hills-cop-ii"><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beverly_Hills_Cop_II">Beverly Hills
Cop II</a></h3>
<p>Eddie Murphy returns to Beverly Hills in a plot that is pretty much
the same as the first movie. Except it is a bit longer and less funnier.
Watched it streaming on Pluto TV.</p>
<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 3/5</p>

<p>See my blog post linked above for more.</p>
<h3 id="night-court"><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_Court">Night Court</a></h3>
<p>A comedy series with 9 seasons and 193 episodes that I watched on
Amazon Prime. It is a sitcom at the night shift of a Manhattan Criminal
Court. It takes a few seasons to settle down to find its sitcom groove
and a permanent cast. The principal characters are all very memorable:
judge Harry T Stone, public defender Christine Sullivan, district
attorney Dan Fielding, clerk Mac Robinson and bailiffs Bull Shannon and
Roz. Some of the situations and writing might not feel politically
correct now, but it is still good hearted fun overall.</p>
<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 4/5</p>
