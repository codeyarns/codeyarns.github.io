<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0456144/">Lage Raho Munna Bhai</a> is the sequel to the movie <a href="http://yodha.livejournal.com/36510.html">Munna Bhai M.B.B.S</a>. The original gang of Munna (Sanjay Dutt) and Circuit (Arshad Warsi) return here for another caper. Munna has fallen in love with Jahnvi (Vidya Balan), a Mumbai RJ. To win her heart he wins a radio contest themed on Gandhi by faking as a history professor. He is now forced to learn everything about Gandhi. A few nights after doing that, Gandhi starts appearing to him! He starts to use Gandhi as a mentor to solve his personal and society's problems.</p>
<p>Kudos to the writers for using the unique concept of Gandhism for their comedy. The movie isn't as funny as the first one, but it's relevant and serious in parts. Sanjay and Arshad Warsi are easy with their roles. Vidya Balan is peppy (a little too much in some cases). Songs are again a distraction from the pace of the movie. Why can't they just do away with them? The pace is fast and never gets boring. Many friends have called this a great movie. I didn't get any such feeling. It's a good movie. 'nuff said!</p>
