<p>I finally wrapped up watching the Star Wars prequel saga after
catching Star Wars Episode III: Revenge Of The Sith. In this final
prequel which ties into the first movie, Anakin Skywalker turns into
Darth Vader. The battle between the Republic and the Separitists is
raging on when Anakin and Obi-Wan rescue General Palpatine. Palpatine
has a soft spot for Anakin and he quickly gains his trust. Also, the
General is slowly growing powerful in the Senate. Meanwhile, Padmé is
pregnant and Anakin is getting nightmares of her death during
childbirth. He loves her too much and is ready to do anything to save
her. Palpatine encashes on this by revealing to him that he knows the
secret of cheating death which he learnt from the Dark Side. The general
turns out to be a Sith Lord!</p>
<p>Torn by his love for Padmé, Anakin becomes an apprentice of
Palpatine, moves over to the Dark Side and acquires the Sith name
<em>Darth Vader</em>. Following his orders, he kills all the Jedi in the
Jedi Temple and heads to Mustafar to kill the Separatists. Also, by an
<em>Order 66</em> all the Clone Troopers are also ordered to kill all
the Jedi they can find. This way the Jedi is almost vanquished with just
Obi-Wan and Yoda surviving. Padmé goes to Mustafar to meet Anakin.
Obi-Wan follows. On the lava filled landscape of Mustafar, a climactic
light saber duel ensues between Obi-Wan and Anakin in which Anakin is
defeated and is burnt to near death by lava. He is rescued by Palpatine
and gets his dark suit. Darth Vader comes to life. On the other side,
Padmé does die during childbirth giving birth to the twins Luke and
Leia.</p>
<p>I liked The Phantom Menace and found Attack Of The Clones extremely
boring. ROTS in comparison is quite good. Anakin’s transition into the
Dark Side is convincing. The effects and the new planets are enjoyable.
This is a good watch. I now need to watch the original 3 movies to
finish the series!</p>
