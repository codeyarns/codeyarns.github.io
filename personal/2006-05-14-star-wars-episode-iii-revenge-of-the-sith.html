<p>I finally wrapped up watching the Star Wars prequel saga after catching Star Wars Episode III: Revenge Of The Sith. In this final prequel which ties into the first movie, Anakin Skywalker turns into Darth Vader. The battle between the Republic and the Separitists is raging on when Anakin and Obi-Wan rescue General Palpatine. Palpatine has a soft spot for Anakin and he quickly gains his trust. Also, the General is slowly growing powerful in the Senate. Meanwhile, Padmé is pregnant and Anakin is getting nightmares of her death during childbirth. He loves her too much and is ready to do anything to save her. Palpatine encashes on this by revealing to him that he knows the secret of cheating death which he learnt from the Dark Side. The general turns out to be a Sith Lord!</p>
<p>Torn by his love for Padmé, Anakin becomes an apprentice of Palpatine, moves over to the Dark Side and acquires the Sith name <em>Darth Vader</em>. Following his orders, he kills all the Jedi in the Jedi Temple and heads to Mustafar to kill the Separatists. Also, by an <em>Order 66</em> all the Clone Troopers are also ordered to kill all the Jedi they can find. This way the Jedi is almost vanquished with just Obi-Wan and Yoda surviving. Padmé goes to Mustafar to meet Anakin. Obi-Wan follows. On the lava filled landscape of Mustafar, a climactic light saber duel ensues between Obi-Wan and Anakin in which Anakin is defeated and is burnt to near death by lava. He is rescued by Palpatine and gets his dark suit. Darth Vader comes to life. On the other side, Padmé does die during childbirth giving birth to the twins Luke and Leia.</p>
<p>I liked The Phantom Menace and found Attack Of The Clones extremely boring. ROTS in comparison is quite good. Anakin's transition into the Dark Side is convincing. The effects and the new planets are enjoyable. This is a good watch. I now need to watch the original 3 movies to finish the series!</p>
