<p>This is a collection of books that our kids loved to read this
year.</p>
<h2 id="books-loved-by-9-year-old">Books loved by 9-year old</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Guts (by Raina Telgemeier): Every graphic novel by this author is
based on her personal life and it really shows in the kinds of detail
she depicts. This one is quite mature, looking at how the relationship
of the author evolved with her sister as their new brother joined their
family.</p></li>
<li><p>Out of my Dreams (by Sharon M. Draper): Another followup to the
Out of my Mind that my son read with rapt interest.</p></li>
<li><p>Out of my Heart (by Sharon M. Draper): Final book in the Out of
my Mind series.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="books-loved-by-4-year-old">Books loved by 4-year old</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>And to Think That I Saw It On Mulberry Street (by Dr. Seuss):
Apparently the very first book by Dr. Seuss. Incredible to imagine that
he knocked it out of the park in the very first one. All his familiar
strokes are already in his first book: inventive new words, rhyming
story and great art.</p></li>
<li><p>Dr. Seuss’s Sleep Book (by Dr. Seuss): Incredible inventive
sleeptime rhyming poem.</p></li>
<li><p>The Lorax (by Dr. Seuss): Lorax, thneed and other amazing words
in this pertinent story about nature and human greed.</p></li>
<li><p>The Sneetches And Other Stories (by Dr. Seuss): Many lovely
bedtimes reading the funny rhyming stories to my girl.</p></li>
<li><p>Dr. Seuss’s Horse Museum (by Dr. Seuss): An introduction to the
various forms of art by using the horse as an example. As an adult, even
I found this to be entertaining and educational.</p></li>
<li><p>Robot Dreams (by Sara Varon): An entire graphic novel with no
words about the friendship and separation of a dog and a robot. My
daughter strangely loved it, but I felt really moved by the book myself.
There are so many of life’s adult moments that the author portrays
poignantly with no pomp.</p></li>
</ul>
