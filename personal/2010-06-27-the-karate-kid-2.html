<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/4 (Get lost in the fun world of Jackie
Chan and Chinese kung fu in <strong>The Karate Kid</strong>, a perfect
homage to the original)</p>
<p>The new <strong><a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Karate_Kid_%282010_film%29">The
Karate Kid</a></strong> movie is hard to resist for anyone who likes the
<a href="2007-07-03-the-karate-kid.html">original 1984 movie</a>, with
the unforgettable character of Mr. Miyagi and his student’s
<strong>Crane kick</strong>. The new movie is a perfect homage to the
older one pitting Jaden Smith as the student and Jackie Chan as his
guru. How the times have changed! In the old movie, the kid and his mom
move to California and the teacher is an immigrant from Japan who
teaches Karate. In keeping with the rapidly changing geopolitics of our
time, Dre (Jaden Smith) and him mom move from Detroit (USA) to China,
following the move of the auto industry. And when Dre is bullied, when
he tries to flirt with a cute Chinese girl, he turns to Mr. Han (Jackie
Chan), a maintainence man. Mr. Han teaches him <strong>kung fu</strong>,
this is China afterall and <strong>karate</strong> is a Japanese martial
art. The movie pretty much follows the original completely, with a
<strong>Cobra maneuver</strong> replacing the cult-classic Crane kick.
For the few who are not familiar with the old movie, the bully belongs
to a bad-ass kung fu training school, where the teacher teaches an evil
no-mercy version of the art. Dre and the bully collide frequently, and
they decide to face off in a kung fu tournament to settle their
differences. Mr. Han trains Dre, he uses Dre’s bad habit of not hanging
up his jacket to teach him the basic moves. (This replaces the
<strong>wax on, wax off</strong> routine of Mr. Miyagi.) Dre is ready
after a couple of cool training montages and spectacular journeys
through Chinese mountains and temples. Though the bully tries some
unjust moves on Dre at the tournament, Dre finally prevails and earns
the respect of everyone.</p>
<p>The movie is completely set in China, with almost all scenes shot on
location. Most of the action takes place in Beijing (which I visited
last year) and I found myself noticing and recalling the places, food,
language and other cultural references. Surprising for a Hollywood
movie, Dre and his mom are the only principal American actors, everyone
else is Chinese. This makes this remake a lot more fresher and
believable. The casting in the movie could not have been more perfect.
Jaden Smith, the son of Will Smith, does not do a Dakot Fanning and
delivers a believable performance. Taraji P. Henson, as his mom brings
laughs to every single scene. Jackie Chan is peppy and charming as
always, delivering almost all the fun of the movie. The grubby
maintenance man look fits Chan perfectly, since he has finally started
to show some age. Wen Wen Han (Dre’s crush) is very cute and Zhenwei
Wang plays the perfect school bully to Dre. The Chinese locations are
all spectacular, Forbidden City and The Temple of Heaven Park in
Beijing, The Great Wall of China and the Wudang Mountains (location of
the fake <strong>Dragon Well</strong>). The movie concentrates a lot
more on the characters than on the kung fu, which is a relief. Even the
matches in the final tournament are very short and quick, with very few
moves. The movie had me completely sucked me into its world and I did
not even notice its 2+ hour length! No matter what your age <strong>The
Karate Kid</strong> will be hard to resist! 😊</p>
