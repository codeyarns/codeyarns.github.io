<p>A man wakes up in a house without any memory of his entire life. Directions and letters from his pre-amnesiac self guide him to regularly visit a doctor Dr. Randle and help him lead a normal life amidst society. As he slowly pieces his life together from scratch, he discovers that he is <strong>Eric Sanderson</strong>, a guy who traumatically lost his mind after the death of his lover <strong>Clio Aames</strong> during a Greek vacation. While building himself back a personality, he is one day violently attacked by a predator from his thoughts, a shark that feeds on human memories, named <strong>Ludovician</strong>. It is the quest to defeat this predator that inspires the book’s title <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Raw_Shark_Texts"><strong>The Raw Shark Texts</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Armed with his cat Ian and a set of dictaphones which create a <em>loop</em> (that evades the shark), Eric is on the run across England in search of a mysterious <strong>Dr. Trey Fidorous</strong>. This quest brings him to a <strong>Nobody</strong>, who traitorously leads the Ludovician right to him. Saved from the shark by a girl named <strong>Scout</strong>, he follows her on a long romp through the <strong>un-space</strong> to finally the world of Fidorous - built entirely from scraps of printed text. Scout and Fidorous convince Eric that the way to end his misery is by luring the Ludovician and driving a spear through its head. In a scene-for-scene copy of the <strong>Jaws</strong> movie climax, they design a fishing vessel named <strong>Orpheus</strong>, transport it into the world of memories, lure the shark and try to kill it.</p>
<p>What is interesting about the book is the alternate world of thoughts and memories, predatorial creatures swimming in it, and our hero’s quest through the <em>un-space</em> world of text to kill his assassin. Apparently, this book belongs to the genre of metafiction, which deals with this sort of concepts. But sadly I could not be bothered since the book did not feel unique, but like I experienced entire parts of Memento, Matrix, Alice in Wonderland and Jaws. There are whiffs of Murakami-like magic reality here and in its failings you realize how difficult writing is. I could have forgiven everything about this story, if only it were not so terribly long, verbose and repetitive. Especially parts 2 and 3, dealing with Eric’s quest and Fidorous’s world, were a real torture to wade through. It is the Jaws-climax in part 4 where the book finally gets fast and interesting, but also very unoriginal. This debut novel by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Hall_(author)"><strong>Steven Hall</strong></a> has some great ideas, but I honestly cannot recommend it due to its length and tepidity.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 2/4</p>
