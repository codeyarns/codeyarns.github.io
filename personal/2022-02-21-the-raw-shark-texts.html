<p>A man wakes up in a house without any memory of his entire life.
Directions and letters from his pre-amnesiac self guide him to regularly
visit a doctor Dr. Randle and help him lead a normal life amidst
society. As he slowly pieces his life together from scratch, he
discovers that he is <strong>Eric Sanderson</strong>, a guy who
traumatically lost his mind after the death of his lover <strong>Clio
Aames</strong> during a Greek vacation. While building himself back a
personality, he is one day violently attacked by a predator from his
thoughts, a shark that feeds on human memories, named
<strong>Ludovician</strong>. It is the quest to defeat this predator
that inspires the book’s title <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Raw_Shark_Texts"><strong>The Raw
Shark Texts</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Armed with his cat Ian and a set of dictaphones which create a
<em>loop</em> (that evades the shark), Eric is on the run across England
in search of a mysterious <strong>Dr. Trey Fidorous</strong>. This quest
brings him to a <strong>Nobody</strong>, who traitorously leads the
Ludovician right to him. Saved from the shark by a girl named
<strong>Scout</strong>, he follows her on a long romp through the
<strong>un-space</strong> to finally the world of Fidorous - built
entirely from scraps of printed text. Scout and Fidorous convince Eric
that the way to end his misery is by luring the Ludovician and driving a
spear through its head. In a scene-for-scene copy of the
<strong>Jaws</strong> movie climax, they design a fishing vessel named
<strong>Orpheus</strong>, transport it into the world of memories, lure
the shark and try to kill it.</p>
<p>What is interesting about the book is the alternate world of thoughts
and memories, predatorial creatures swimming in it, and our hero’s quest
through the <em>un-space</em> world of text to kill his assassin.
Apparently, this book belongs to the genre of metafiction, which deals
with this sort of concepts. But sadly I could not be bothered since the
book did not feel unique, but like I experienced entire parts of
Memento, Matrix, Alice in Wonderland and Jaws. There are whiffs of
Murakami-like magic reality here and in its failings you realize how
difficult writing is. I could have forgiven everything about this story,
if only it were not so terribly long, verbose and repetitive. Especially
parts 2 and 3, dealing with Eric’s quest and Fidorous’s world, were a
real torture to wade through. It is the Jaws-climax in part 4 where the
book finally gets fast and interesting, but also very unoriginal. This
debut novel by <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Hall_(author)"><strong>Steven
Hall</strong></a> has some great ideas, but I honestly cannot recommend
it due to its length and tepidity.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 2/4</p>
