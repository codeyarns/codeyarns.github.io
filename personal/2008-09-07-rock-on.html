<p>After sampling <strong>Farhan Akhtar</strong>’s acting (and singing)
debut <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_On!!"><strong>Rock
On!!</strong></a>, I was not exactly eager to see it. Friends on a
Saturday evening convinced me otherwise. Farhan and Arjun Rampal are two
of the four members of a rock band. The rock band falls apart just after
they win a chance to record an album. 10 years later, the band members
are stuck in mundane jobs when Farhan’s wife discovers his old rock
photos and calls for a reunion of the band. That slowly leads them to
come together for one last act.</p>
<p>This will be the last time I say this – Hindi movies are now just as
technically good as Hollywood ones. Casting, script, styling and
cinematography are all top notch here just as with most movies I have
been seeing over the last couple of years. Rock On!! is one long rock
act, do not make the mistake I did – judging this movie based on the
music. You will love the music after you have seen the movie! The live
performances have all been shot very well. My feet were tapping all
through, yes the silly lyrics (thanks to the subtitles) really work in
the movie. The story is predictable, but I doubt it has been done in
Hindi before. There is good humour all through and the movie never slows
or feels boring. Farhan has acting chops, especially the lost-soul-like
scenes. Farhan’s grating voice actually works with the songs, but sounds
odd when he speaks loudly or shouts. Rock On!! is a fun movie that
should not be missed! 😊</p>
