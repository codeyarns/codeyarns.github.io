<p>After sampling <strong>Farhan Akhtar</strong>'s acting (and singing) debut <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_On!!"><strong>Rock On!!</strong></a>, I was not exactly eager to see it. Friends on a Saturday evening convinced me otherwise. Farhan and Arjun Rampal are two of the four members of a rock band. The rock band falls apart just after they win a chance to record an album. 10 years later, the band members are stuck in mundane jobs when Farhan's wife discovers his old rock photos and calls for a reunion of the band. That slowly leads them to come together for one last act.</p>
<p>This will be the last time I say this -- Hindi movies are now just as technically good as Hollywood ones. Casting, script, styling and cinematography are all top notch here just as with most movies I have been seeing over the last couple of years. Rock On!! is one long rock act, do not make the mistake I did -- judging this movie based on the music. You will love the music after you have seen the movie! The live performances have all been shot very well. My feet were tapping all through, yes the silly lyrics (thanks to the subtitles) really work in the movie. The story is predictable, but I doubt it has been done in Hindi before. There is good humour all through and the movie never slows or feels boring. Farhan has acting chops, especially the lost-soul-like scenes. Farhan's grating voice actually works with the songs, but sounds odd when he speaks loudly or shouts. Rock On!! is a fun movie that should not be missed! :-)</p>
