<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 4/4 (Hilarious!)</p>
<p>Read a Wodehouse after a gap of many years, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Code_of_the_Woosters">The Code Of The Woosters</a>. As always, simple minded <em>Bertie</em> is in the soup. He has gotten on the wrong side of Sir Watkyn Bassett and his close pal Spode for trying to grab a silverware for his Uncle Tom, which Bassett had an eye on. Aunt Dahlia (Tom's wife) sends him to Totleigh Towers to steal it. Also, at Totleigh Towers, Bertie's pal Gussie is preparing to get married to Madeline (Watkyn's daughter). Meanwhile, Stiffy (Watkyn's nice) is in love with Pinker (another pal of Bertie). When Bertie arrives at Totleigh Towers, everything that can go wrong with the lives of these people, breaks loose. And all of them are aimed at Bertie! Bertie faces all of it with the help of his faithful butler Jeeves and all ends well.</p>
<p>If there were no sitcom on TV, Wodehouse would have invented it! This book is filled with outlandish characters, outrageous dialogues, all set in rich classic Britain. I could not help laughing out loud while reading this book. Between all these stormy characters is the real hero of the books -- Jeeves with his cucumber cool air. Wodehouse cannot be explained, his books have to be read. I see a definite (Bollywood?) movie potential in his books. In case you were wondering, <em>The Code Of The Woosters</em> is &quot;Never let a pal down.&quot;</p>
