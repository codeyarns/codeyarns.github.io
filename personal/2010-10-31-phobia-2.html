<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 2/4 (A decent compilation of horror shorts.)</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phobia_2"><strong>Phobia 2</strong></a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phobia_2">ห้าแพร่ง</a>) is a 2009 Thai horror movie that is a sequel to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4bia"><strong>Phobia</strong></a>. Like the original, it is composed of many short movies, 5 in this case. In <strong>Novice</strong>, a boy is hidden away in a forest monastery to save him from his crime of killing a person on the road. During a ghost festival, he discovers that he will be made to pay for his karma by the forest ghosts. In <strong>Ward</strong>, a cocky teenager has to spend a night in a ward with a brain-dead person kept on life support in the next bed. Horror ensues when he discovers that his roommate's soul is looking for a new body. In <strong>Backpackers</strong>, a Japanese teen couple backpacking through Thailand are beset by zombies. In <strong>Salvage</strong>, a car dealer who refurbishes wrecked cars from fatal accidents finds her son assailed by the ghosts of the accident victims. The final <strong>In The End</strong> is a story where a film crew is shooting the last scene of a horror movie. Hilarity ensues when the actress playing the ghost gets sick, dies in the hospital and comes back to finish her scene.</p>
<p>In recent years, Hollywood seems to have run dry on good horror ideas, while Asia has stepped in with fresh stories using its myriad cultures and scenarios. I have never been able to sit through a typical full-length Hollywood horror movie  anyway, where the focus has been mostly on gore and scares. Bollywood ventures like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darna_Mana_Hai"><strong>Darna Mana Hai</strong></a> and the Thai <strong>Phobia</strong> series have tackled this problem with innovative horror shorts. Phobia 2 is a pretty nice venture, but nowhere as innovative as Phobia was. I liked Novice for the way it mixed Buddhism and ghosts deep inside a forest. And it was also hard to not love In The End, which features the same comical cast from the awesome <strong>In The Middle</strong> in the original Phobia. This short is well written and questions all of the cliched horror move twists. Ward had potential, but the implementation loses it. Backpackers is like a Hollywood zombie-fest, which I have no interest in. Salvage too had potential, again lost in mediocre writing. All in all, <strong>Phobia 2</strong> is a decent compilation of horror shorts.</p>
