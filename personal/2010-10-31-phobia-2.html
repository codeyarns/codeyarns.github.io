<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 2/4 (A decent compilation of horror
shorts.)</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phobia_2"><strong>Phobia
2</strong></a> (<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phobia_2">ห้าแพร่ง</a>) is a 2009 Thai
horror movie that is a sequel to <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4bia"><strong>Phobia</strong></a>.
Like the original, it is composed of many short movies, 5 in this case.
In <strong>Novice</strong>, a boy is hidden away in a forest monastery
to save him from his crime of killing a person on the road. During a
ghost festival, he discovers that he will be made to pay for his karma
by the forest ghosts. In <strong>Ward</strong>, a cocky teenager has to
spend a night in a ward with a brain-dead person kept on life support in
the next bed. Horror ensues when he discovers that his roommate’s soul
is looking for a new body. In <strong>Backpackers</strong>, a Japanese
teen couple backpacking through Thailand are beset by zombies. In
<strong>Salvage</strong>, a car dealer who refurbishes wrecked cars from
fatal accidents finds her son assailed by the ghosts of the accident
victims. The final <strong>In The End</strong> is a story where a film
crew is shooting the last scene of a horror movie. Hilarity ensues when
the actress playing the ghost gets sick, dies in the hospital and comes
back to finish her scene.</p>
<p>In recent years, Hollywood seems to have run dry on good horror
ideas, while Asia has stepped in with fresh stories using its myriad
cultures and scenarios. I have never been able to sit through a typical
full-length Hollywood horror movie  anyway, where the focus has been
mostly on gore and scares. Bollywood ventures like <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darna_Mana_Hai"><strong>Darna Mana
Hai</strong></a> and the Thai <strong>Phobia</strong> series have
tackled this problem with innovative horror shorts. Phobia 2 is a pretty
nice venture, but nowhere as innovative as Phobia was. I liked Novice
for the way it mixed Buddhism and ghosts deep inside a forest. And it
was also hard to not love In The End, which features the same comical
cast from the awesome <strong>In The Middle</strong> in the original
Phobia. This short is well written and questions all of the cliched
horror move twists. Ward had potential, but the implementation loses it.
Backpackers is like a Hollywood zombie-fest, which I have no interest
in. Salvage too had potential, again lost in mediocre writing. All in
all, <strong>Phobia 2</strong> is a decent compilation of horror
shorts.</p>
