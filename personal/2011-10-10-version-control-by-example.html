<p>Look what arrived in my snail-mail last weekend: a free dead-tree copy of <a href="http://www.ericsink.com/vcbe/"><strong>Version Control by Example</strong></a> written by <a href="http://www.ericsink.com/"><strong>Eric Sink</strong></a>! üòÅ I know Eric Sink from his <a href="http://www.ericsink.com/scm/source_control.html"><strong>Source Control HOWTO</strong></a>, a series of fantastic introductory posts on the subject. In this book, Eric Sink gives a simple introduction to <strong>version control systems</strong> (VCS), the common operations in a VCS and he illustrates these operations in Subversion, Mercurial, Git and Veracity. The book ends with chapters that dip into the internal workings of <strong>distributed VCS</strong> (DVCS), common workflows of using DVCS and best practices.</p>
<p>Eric Sink is a delightful writer with the talent to make technology accessible and fun. (He reminds me of <strong>Tanenbaum</strong>, whose textbooks I love for the same reason.) I especially loved his analogy of VCS to a multi-threaded program, which he uses all through the book. Before getting into examples, he provides a solid debate on the pros and cons of <strong>centralized VCS</strong> (CVCS) vs. DVCS. After that, he shows a sample workflow between two programmers, one in the USA and other in UK, who have to collaborate on the code of a game using a VCS. He uses this scenario four times, once for each VCS he illustrates in the book. I used to use <strong>Subversion</strong> for my personal work before and my current life completely revolves around <strong>Mercurial</strong>. So, I loved going through the chapters on these VCS, it acted as a good revision. I skipped the chapter on <strong>Git</strong>, after seeing (yet again) how it makes every action more complicated than necessary. The final tool is <strong>Veracity</strong>, an open-source DVCS created by SourceGear which is Eric Sink's company. It adds some extra features needed by commercial users that are not provided in most free DVCS.</p>
<p>Version Control by Example is a super-fast read. It is a practical book, there is nothing to mull or chew over here. If you are either thinking about using a VCS (oh, you must!) or thinking about switching from a CVCS to a DVCS, please pick up this book. The dead-tree version has gaudy page design and is printed on glossy paper. But, once you get over these distractions, the content is good. The book is also available online <a href="http://www.ericsink.com/vcbe/">here</a>.</p>
