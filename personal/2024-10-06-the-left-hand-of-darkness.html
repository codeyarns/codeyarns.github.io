href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursula_K._Le_Guin"><strong>Ursula K.
Le Guin</strong></a> is a popular author in science fiction and whenever
I thought of tasting her works, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Left_Hand_of_Darkness"><strong>The
Left Hand of Darkness</strong></a> would come highly recommended. Set in
some future, we follow along with <em>Genly Ai</em> who is living among
the beings on an incredibly cold planet called <em>Gethen</em>. He is an
envoy from a technologically advanced coalition of planets called
Ekumen, hoping to convince the nations of Gethen to join them. The
beings of Gethen have no gender, but when in a reproductive phase
(called <em>Kemmer</em>), they can consummate with anyone and the one
who bears a child temporarily turns female. There seem to be primarily
two big nations on Gethen, a monarchy called Karhide and their
neighboring Communist-like nation Orgoreyn. After having lived in
Karhide for a while, Ai is rebuffed by the king Argaven and both he and
the prime minister Estraven face banishment. They travel in different
ways to Orgoreyn, which seems like a better place at first, until both
Ai and Estraven discover the machinations of their secret police (Sarf).
Ai is saved from a Gulag-like prison in the cold North by Estraven and
they undertake a perilous escape over the ice to return to Karhide and
call his space ship to help Gethenians join Ekumen.</p>
<p>Le Guin is able to create an intriguing world with a different kind
of humanoid beings and a different terminology for them in this book.
The characters Ai and Estraven are memorable, though the rest of them
seem thin. There is a ton of world building here which I loved, with a
lot of it centered around ways to survive and thrive on a cold planet.
The plot is interesting, though there are many myths and side stories
that I found distracting. An excessively large part of the book involves
Ai’s thoughts, experiences and acceptance of the genderless life of the
residents of Gethen. The third escape act is thrilling to read, though
very predictable and movie-like.</p>
<p>I read the hardcover that was a part of the Penguin Galaxy and this
had a fantastic introduction to science fiction and to the 6 books in
this series by Neil Gaiman. The cover design is pretty neat too, if you
want to own and collect this book, this is probably the one to pick. The
book itself I thought was OK, but not great enough for me to reread it
again in the future.</p>
<p>And in case you were wondering, the title comes from a Gethenian poem
<em>“Light is the left hand of darkness, and darkness the right hand of
light.”</em></p>
<p><strong>ISBN</strong>: 9780143111597</p>
<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 3/4</p>
