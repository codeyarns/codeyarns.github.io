<p>In recent months I have been lurking on <a
href="http://www.booktalk.org/">BookTalk</a>, a book discussion
community of <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freethought">freethinkers</a>. Every
quarter they discuss a work of fiction and non-fiction each. For me it
is just a good place for book recommendations. The non-fiction work
being <a href="http://p090.ezboard.com/fbooktalkfrm105">discussed</a> in
the 3rd quarter of 2006 is <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaking_the_spell">Breaking The
Spell: Religion As A Natural Phenomenon</a> by philosopher <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_C._Dennett">Daniel C.
Dennett</a>. In this book, Dennett tries to look at religion as a
natural entity and attempts to examine all facets of it using the
scientific method.</p>
<p>The spell that Dennett is trying to break here is that of religion
and also of the oft-heard saying that religion can’t be <em>studied</em>
by science. The book is divided into 3 parts:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Opening Pandora’s Box — Can religion be defined? How to define
religion? Why should religion be studied as a natural entity? Can/should
science study religion? <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cui_bono">Cui bono?</a> Who benefits
from religion?</p></li>
<li><p>The Evolution Of Religion — Why was religion born in nature? Why
were Gods <em>born</em>? Why did folk religions domesticate into
mainstream religions?</p></li>
<li><p>Religion Today — Is it religion that keeps society sane and
moral? Is it religion that gives meaning to life?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Dennett is good at analogies. He draws comparisons to music, money,
language, sex, sports, literature and other such entities related to
humans in his explanation of religion. He draws on a huge compendium of
writing on evolution, memes and religion, with detailed endnotes and
countless quotes. This was the first time I was reading a work that put
religion into a clean, non-emotional scientific analysis. Dennett
succeeds in asking the right questions, which as he confesses is harder
than answering them. Some of the biggest influences in his study of
religion are Charles Darwin’s <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Origin_of_Species">The Origin Of
Species</a> and Richard Dawkins’ <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Selfish_Gene">The Selfish
Gene</a>. The former is the forerunner to the discovery of the
<strong>gene</strong> (an unit of biological evolution) while the latter
introduces the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme"><strong>meme</strong></a> (an
unit of cultural evolution). I knew about the meme before, but Dennett
<em>applies</em> it to explain the evolution of religion. It was here
that I felt that the idea of the meme was so revolutionary that I’ve now
resolved to read Dawkins’ book.</p>
<p>The book is primarily aimed at those who are religious, though it
gives loads of ammo for the non-believer. The book introduced so many
things that I wasn’t even aware of about evolution, cultures and the
scientific method. I’ve got a higher respect for Darwin now. On the
downside, the book is very verbose. I couldn’t help but feel that
Dennett could’ve easily removed loads of stuff and made the flow
tighter. The book is also quite big at 448 pages which includes 4
appendices (which I conveniently skipped). In fact, the book introduced
so many lines of debate and thought that I need to re-read it again to
get a fuller understanding. I will reserve my final judgement about this
book until then.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/4</p>
