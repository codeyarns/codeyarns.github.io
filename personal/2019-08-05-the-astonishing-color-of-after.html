<p>I typically do not read books labeled as <em>Young Adult (YA)</em>. I
did not realize that <strong>The Astonishing Color of After</strong> was
a YA novel and by the time I did, I was so interested that I had to
persist. This debut novel by <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_X.R._Pan"><strong>Emily X. R.
Pan</strong></a> begins moments after teenager Leigh’s mother Dora has
slashed and killed herself. One of the nights following her death, Dora
visits Leigh as a red bird and leaves her a box filled with artifacts
from her past. With that box and incense sticks she discovers at her
mother’s parents home in Taiwan, Leigh starts on a journey to find
answers to the many questions she has about the red bird and her
mother.</p>
<p>This novel is literally suffused with color. Our narrator Leigh is an
art student and her emotions are always described through colors. There
is a lot about Taiwanese and Chinese history, language, culture and food
in the story. But the overarching character is <em>depression</em>,
which killed Dora. The word depression itself appears way late in the
book, only towards the end of a series of incense-fuelled magical
flashbacks through which we see how a talented and loving mother
descended bit by bit into it and how it affected her family.</p>
<p>For a debut novel this one is surprisingly good. From the
<em>Author’s Note</em> at the end, it is apparent that Emily based Leigh
on her Asian-American self and the death on a similar suicide in her own
family. That might be why I felt that the story and characters to be
genuinely interesting and the family and teenage moments as intense.
Suicide and depression are delicately handled and I discovered a lot
about this subject through this book. The real problem with this book is
that it is too long at 450 pages. The first half is especially stretched
out and it is only in the second half that everything gets very
interesting. Emily throws in a few filmi twists too in the climax. This
was a thoughtful read, but I would have loved the experienced a lot more
if it had been way shorter.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 3/4 (★★★☆)</p>
<p><strong>ISBN:</strong> 9780316464017</p>
