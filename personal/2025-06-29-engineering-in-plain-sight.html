<p><a
href="https://nostarch.com/engineering-plain-sight"><strong>Engineering
in Plain Sight</strong></a> is a fully illustrated book by <a
href="https://practical.engineering/"><strong>Grady
Hillhouse</strong></a>, that describes the design and workings of the
public infrastructure that we see around us. It covered literally
everything including the electrical grid, communications, roads,
railways, bridges, tunnels, dams, coastal structures, water supply and
construction sites. Full page illustrations with detailed labels
accompany almost every page of text and were invaluable in helping me
examine and understand these things I see in everyday life.</p>
<p>Page after page, I continuously marveled at the innumerable practical
innovations in the engineering of these big and massive projects and the
many basic facts that I honestly did not even know about. For example,
the supply of electricity from the power plant all the way until the
final utility pole in front of my home, is carried through 3 (not 2)
wires, each carrying AC current with a 120 degree phase difference with
the other! How had I missed this - I went out and was amazed to find the
3 power lines everywhere near my home - from the high voltage towers to
the humble utility poles. Another example is the simple twist lock
mechanism at the four top corners of containers that enable them to be
lifted and placed by cranes, carriers and stackers from its source to
its final destination.</p>
<p>The book exceeded my expectations, by getting into brief but deep
descriptions of every civil engineering construct around us. The
illustrations are truly great and I am surprised that the design firm <a
href="https://studiomuti.co.za/">MUTI</a> and Brad Hodgskiss are not
credited as illustrator on the cover. The author Grady is apparently
popular on Youtube with his channel <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMOqf8ab-42UUQIdVoKwjlQ"><strong>Practical
Engineering</strong></a>, which I am truly curious to follow. His
enthusiasm for observing how everything outside is designed and built is
infectious and I have now found myself pointing out these structures to
my son when we are driving around. Another aspect that I loved was that
I now have the terminology for all the structures and parts of these
civil engineering constructs - I have always loved to know the right
word to use. The book also has a glossary and an index that make it a
great reference work. It is rare to find a book that suddenly unlocks
our understanding of such a huge part of the world around us and so I
highly recommend this one.</p>
