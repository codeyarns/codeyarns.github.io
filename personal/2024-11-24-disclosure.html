<p>[First read 2006-01-17 and updated after second read 2024-11-23]</p>
<p>Reading <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disclosure_(novel)"><strong>Disclosure</strong></a>
in 2024, it is hard to believe that this was published in 1993. It
almost feels like <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Crichton"><strong>Michael
Crichton</strong></a> could have been written this recently, in the wake
of the MeToo and DEI movements at workplaces and virtual/augmented
reality in the tech sphere.</p>
<p>Our hero <em>Tom Sanders</em> is a division manager at DigiCom and is
facing gnarly production problems in bringing a high-speed hand-held
CD-ROM player to market. Meanwhile, DigiCom is undergoing due diligence
before an acquisition by a wealthy publishing company. Tom’s dreams of
being promoted to VP in the new company are dashed when CEO <em>Bob
Garvin</em> chooses an inexperienced marketing head <em>Meredith
Johnson</em> for the role. Meredith invites Tom to her office to discuss
the CD-ROM problems and instead harkens to their old relationship and
attempts to have sex with him against his wishes. After he spurns her,
she in turn complains to HR that she was sexually harassed by him. This
defamation threatens to shatter his family and the career he had built
over years. When Tom decides to fight back legally against Meredith he
starts to unravel a mysterious plot behind her speedy ascent, the
production problems with the CD-ROM player and the acquisition
itself.</p>
<p>Let me just say it - if you are in the tech industry, this book will
be un-put-downable. Set amidst the Seattle and SF Bay Area tech
industry, I thought that the internal politics and functioning of a tech
company is portrayed accurately here. The technical details of the
<em>Corridor</em> VR system and the problems of the <em>Twinkle</em>
CD-ROM player are genuinely interesting and intriguing. The book gets
into the intimate details of the power play inside a tech company under
acquisition.</p>
<p>Crichton has the knack of getting into the uncomfortable edges of the
societal rhetoric on sexual harassment. He reverses the conventional
roles in such a case and shows the incredible difficulties a man might
need to tide over to prove his innocence. He also dunks his plot and
characters deep into the laws and legal procedures using his ice-cool
lawyer <em>Fernandez</em>. In addition to all this, the plot is also
genuinely mysterious, revealing layer upon layers as we probe it
further. In my opinion, Disclosure is easily one of his best works,
alongside the 2 Jurassic Park novels.</p>
<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 5/5</p>

<h2 id="excerpts">Excerpts</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The Corridor was what everyone at DigiCom called VIE: the Virtual
Information Environment. VIE was the companion piece to Twinkle, the
second major element in the emerging future of digital information as
envisioned by DigiCom. In the future, information was going to be stored
on disks, or made available in large databases that users would dial
into over telephone lines. At the moment, users saw information
displayed on flat screens—either televisions or computer screens. That
had been the traditional way of handling information for the last thirty
years. But soon, there would be new ways to present information. The
most radical, and the most exciting, was virtual environments. Users
wore special glasses to see computer-generated, three-dimensional
environments which allowed them to feel as though they were literally
moving through another world. Dozens of high-tech companies were racing
to develop virtual environments. It was exciting, but very difficult,
technology. At DigiCom, VIE was one of Garvin’s pet projects; he had
thrown a lot of money at it; he had had Don Cherry’s programmers working
on it around the clock for two years.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Let me review your problems,” she said. She ticked them off on her
fingers. “One: you claim that you got into an intimate situation with a
younger, very attractive woman but you turned her down. In the absence
of witnesses or corroborating evidence, that isn’t going to be an easy
story to sell to a jury. “Two: if you bring a lawsuit, the company will
fire you. You’re looking at three years before you come to trial. You
have to think about how you’ll support yourself during that time, about
how you’ll make your house payments, and your other expenses. “Three: a
lawsuit will bring all this out into the open. It’ll be in the papers
and on the evening news for years before the trial begins. I can’t
adequately describe how destructive an experience that is—for you, and
for your wife and family. Many families don’t survive the pre-trial
period intact. There are divorces, suicides, illnesses. It’s very
difficult. “Four: because of the offer of lateral transfer, it’s not
clear what we can claim as damages. The company will claim that you have
no case, and we’ll have to fight it. But even with a stunning victory,
you may end up with only a couple of hundred thousand dollars after
expenses and fees and three years of your life. And of course the
company can appeal, delaying payment further. “Five: if you bring a
lawsuit, you’ll never work in this industry again. I know it’s not
supposed to work that way, but as a practical matter, you’ll never be
hired for another job. That’s just how it goes. It would be one thing if
you were fifty-five. But you’re only forty-one. I don’t know if you want
to make that choice, at this point in your life.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Unfortunately, the law has nothing to do with justice, Mr. Sanders,”
she said. “It’s merely a method for dispute resolution.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Sexual harassment had the advantage of being a charge that was
difficult to recover from. You were presumed guilty until proven
innocent—and it was hard to prove innocence. It tarnished any man, no
matter how frivolous the accusation. In that sense, harassment was a
very powerful accusation. The most powerful accusation she could
make.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>After watching these [B-school] graduates come and go, Sanders had
finally concluded that there was a fundamental flaw in their education.
They had been trained to believe that they were equipped to manage
anything. But there was no such thing as general managerial skills and
tools. In the end, there were only specific problems, involving specific
industries and specific workers. To apply general tools to specific
problems was to fail. You needed to know the market, you needed to know
the customers, you needed to know the limits of manufacturing and the
limits of your own creative people. None of that was obvious.</p>
