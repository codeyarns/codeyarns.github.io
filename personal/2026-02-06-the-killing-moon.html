<p>I felt a heavy influence of ancient Hindu mythology and culture (in a
good way) as <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Killing_Moon_(novel)"><strong>The
Killing Moon</strong></a> drew me steadily into its dreamy fantasy
world. The story is centered around the city-state of <em>Gujareh</em>,
where terminally ill or corrupt people (<em>dreamers</em>) are visited
by <em>Gatherers</em> who harvest their <em>dreamblood</em> and send
them off into the <em>Ina-Kareh</em> afterlife. A famed Gatherer named
<em>Ehiru</em> is training his acolyte <em>Nijiri</em> when he is asked
to gather <em>Sunandi</em>, an ambassador from the neighboring land of
<em>Kisua</em>. She reveals to him that she is innocent and that <em>The
Prince</em> of Gujareh has been building warships and recruiting foreign
soldiers in a bid to attack Kisua. Ehiru does not believe this
initially, but the appearance of a brutally killing <em>Reaper</em> and
some stunning discoveries change his mind. The trio become fugitives and
try to warn Kisua before The Prince unleashes his darkest plans using
dreamblood and the Reaper on the Kisua army.</p>
<p>Written by <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N._K._Jemisin"><strong>N. K.
Jemisin</strong></a> this book is the first in the
<strong>Dreamblood</strong> series. Her main innovation is
<em>narcomancy</em>, the use of dreams and dreamblood as a magical
potent force, and build an entire literary universe around it. (Reminds
me of <em>The Sandman</em> by Neil Gaiman.) The story is super
intriguing with memorable characters, interesting stories and many dark
surprises. I felt like she truly created a convincing alternate world
steeped in its own language, words, myths, religion and culture. The
fictional cultural names all felt like ancient Egypt or India and there
was absolutely no Anglo fantasy vibe. All 3 acts were exciting, with the
climactic battle ending in a whimper. But then, it also makes me want to
read the 2nd book to see what else she has up her sleeve.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/5</p>
