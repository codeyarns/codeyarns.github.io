<p>I didn’t expect the tenets of religion to be questioned in a sci-fi
movie. But, in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063442/">Planet Of
The Apes</a> beneath the veneer of a planet ruled by apes are questions
on faith and science. I watched the original 1968 version (there was a
forgettable <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133152/">remake</a> by
Tim Burton in 2001). Taylor (an astronaut from Earth) survives a
18-month long space travel at light speed when his ship crashes on an
alien planet. To his surprise, he finds that the planet is ruled by
intelligent apes. Human-like beings are the beasts of the jungle here!
He is hunted down like a wild animal by the apes and he loses ability to
speak due to a vocal chord injury. Thankfully for him, he is rescued by
Zira, an ape who is studying human behaviour. He captures the attention
of Zira and her fiancée Cornelius and starts conversing with them in
written form.</p>
<p>The ape couple are excited at the discovery of a human beast who is
able to write and think. Strangely their boss Dr. Zaius, the head of
Science and Faith (sic) is not happy. He plots to kill Taylor. Zira and
Cornelius save him and escape to the <em>Forbidden Zone</em> pursued by
Dr. Zaius. In the Forbidden Zone, they find human fossils and are able
to prove that apes on this planet evolved from humans! Taylor goes out
alone to find out the history and evolution of this planet. And he is in
for a shocking revelation.</p>
<p>I loved the movie. It is based on the book <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_of_the_Apes">Planet Of The
Apes</a> by Pierre Boulle. The story is splendid and has enough of
surprises and intelligence all through. The ape-like facial expressions
by the actors look genuine, de-emphasizing the clunky sets. The only
letdown is the monotonous background music which sticks out like a sore
thumb. Faith and science clash in the movie much like the <em><a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_design">Intelligent
Design</a></em> controversy of today. The revelation in the final iconic
scene draws a fitting ending.</p>
