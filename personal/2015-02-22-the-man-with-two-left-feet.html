<p>After many years of reading <strong>Wodehouse</strong> books in a
scatter-shot fashion, I picked a 1917 collection of his short stories
titled <strong>The Man with Two Left Feet</strong>. I chose this one
particularly because I learnt that it features the first appearance of
the inimitable <strong>Wooster and Jeeves</strong>. The 13 stories in
this book are mostly lighthearted, a few are sad and cover a spectrum of
people and situations, set either in London or New York. But all of them
have the Wodehouse stamp: a quirky hand-of-fate event at the end that
sets everything right.</p>
<p>I found a few of the stories worth a note. <strong>Extricating Young
Gussie</strong> has the famous Gussie and Aunt Agatha, in addition to
introducing Wooster and Jeeves. There are two stories of life amidst
humans from the point-of-view of a puppy titled <strong>The
Mixer</strong>. The first one, where the innocent puppy discovers life
with his new master is particularly charming, probably my pick of this
book. Almost half the stories deal with love and most of those have that
<strong>O’Henry</strong> feel and twist.</p>
<p>Not having read any short stories of Wodehouse, I must say I was
pleasantly surprised to see his range outside of Jeeves. Even in these
early works, one can see the appearance of his trademark wit and charm.
The collection is suitable for easy noon reading and sure to make you
snicker along with the pages.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 3/4</p>
<p><strong>ISBN:</strong> 9781590202418</p>
