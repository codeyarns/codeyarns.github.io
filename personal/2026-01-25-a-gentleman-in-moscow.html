<p>Prepare to get lost on a most beautiful journey in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Gentleman_in_Moscow"><strong>A
Gentleman in Moscow</strong></a>. We start a little after Lenin’s 1917
Bolshevik Revolution in Russia, with a <em>Count</em> (the
<em>gentleman</em> of the title), being placed under house arrest at the
prestigious <em>Hotel Metropol</em> in Moscow. He is forced to vacate
his luxurious room and possessions and is moved to servant’s room in the
attic with his books. Accepting his fate with surprising calm, the Count
settles down to live in the hotel the entire rest of his life!</p>
<p>Through his limited window into the outside world, we witness the
Soviet Russia of 1922-1960, rise and fall of Stalin, the ups and downs
of Russian life and its effect on the people coming through the hotel
doors. We witness the Count’s punctual and perfect lifestyle and
etiquette, his vast knowledge of literature, history, culture and
languages in intimate detail. He gets to enjoy a slice of fatherhood
with the precocious “girl in yellow” Nina (or maybe relive his departed
sister Helina). He watches as the fate of his old working class friend
Mikhail rises and later falls with the great Communist experiment. Also
throw in a love interest with the movie star Anna Urbanova. And finally
all of his talents come to bear as he steps in to run the acclaimed
restaurant at the hotel along with his chef friends Emile and Andrey. In
a nailbiting climax, we ride along a thrilling escapade he plans for his
god child and possibly his own escape?</p>
<p>From the first page to the last, this book by <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amor_Towles"><strong>Amor
Towles</strong></a> is an extremely joyful experience. We sample a
seemingly infinite spectrum of foods, culture, language and etiquette.
Through the hotel doors arrive an endless array of interesting
characters who enter the Count’s life and ours. And throw in the
historical era of Russia this story is placed in and throw in a few
delightful surprises. Every page drips with wise quotable quotes and
made me taste them over and over again before moving on. All three acts
are tight and even at 450+ pages, the story could have continued and I
would have hung on. What we get is a multi-layered cake where every
layer delights on its own and together it is a literary smorgasbord.
Truly a great pleasurable novel, akin to a Dickens classic.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 5/5</p>

<h2 id="excerpts">Excerpts</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>We come to hold our dearest possessions more closely than we hold our
friends. We carry them from place to place, often at considerable
expense and inconvenience; we dust and polish their surfaces and
reprimand children for playing too roughly in their vicinity—all the
while, allowing memories to invest them with greater and greater
importance. Until we imagine that these carefully preserved possessions
might give us genuine solace in the face of a lost companion.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Adversity presents itself in many forms; and that if a man does not
master his circumstances then he is bound to be mastered by them.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It was a book for when the birds had flown south, the wood was
stacked by the fireplace, and the fields were white with snow; that is,
for when one had no desire to venture out and one’s friends had no
desire to venture in.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A new generation owes a measure of thanks to every member of the
previous generation. Our elders planted fields and fought in wars; they
advanced the arts and sciences, and generally made sacrifices on our
behalf. So by their efforts, however humble, they have earned a measure
of our gratitude and respect.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Manners are not like bonbons, Nina. You may not choose the ones that
suit you best; and you certainly cannot put the half-bitten ones back in
the box.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Pomp is a tenacious force. And a wily one too. How humbly it bows its
head as the emperor is dragged down the steps and tossed in the street.
But then, having quietly bided its time, while helping the newly
appointed leader on with his jacket, it compliments his appearance and
suggests the wearing of a medal or two. Or, having served him at a
formal dinner, it wonders aloud if a taller chair might not have been
more fitting for a man with such responsibilities. The soldiers of the
common man may toss the banners of the old regime on the victory pyre,
but soon enough trumpets will blare and pomp will take its place at the
side of the throne, having once again secured its dominion over history
and kings.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If a room that exists under the governance, authority, and intent of
others seems smaller than it is, then a room that exists in secret can,
regardless of its dimensions, seem as vast as one cares to imagine.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The Bolsheviks assembled whenever possible in whichever form for
whatever reason. In a single week, there might be committees, caucuses,
colloquiums, congresses, and conventions variously coming together to
establish codes, set courses of action, levy complaints, and generally
clamor about the world’s oldest problems in its newest nomenclature.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Fate would not have the reputation it has if it simply did what it
seemed it would do.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What can a first impression tell us about anyone? Why, no more than a
chord can tell us about Beethoven, or a brushstroke about Botticelli. By
their very nature, human beings are so capricious, so complex, so
delightfully contradictory, that they deserve not only our
consideration, but our reconsideration—and our unwavering determination
to withhold our opinion until we have engaged with them in every
possible setting at every possible hour.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When a man has been underestimated by a friend, he has some cause for
taking offense—since it is our friends who should overestimate our
capacities. They should have an exaggerated opinion of our moral
fortitude, our aesthetic sensibilities, and our intellectual scope. Why,
they should practically imagine us leaping through a window in the nick
of time with the works of Shakespeare in one hand and a pistol in the
other!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If patience wasn’t so easily tested, then it would hardly be a
virtue.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>With Chekhov and Tolstoy, we Russians have set the bronze bookends on
the mantelpiece of narrative. Henceforth, writers of fictions from
wheresoever they hail, will place themselves on the continuum that
begins with the one and ends with the other. For who, I ask you, has
exhibited better mastery of the shorter form than Chekhov in his
flawless little stories? Precise and uncluttered, they invite us into
some corner of a household at some discrete hour in which the entire
human condition is suddenly within reach, if heartbreakingly so. While
at the other extreme: Can you conceive of a work greater in scope than
War and Peace? One that moves so deftly from the parlor to the
battlefield and back again? That so fully investigates how the
individual is shaped by history, and history by the individual? In the
generations to come, I tell you there will be no new authors to supplant
these two as the alpha and omega of narrative.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Jazz seemed a naturally gregarious force—one that was a little unruly
and prone to say the first thing that popped into its head, but
generally of good humor and friendly intent. In addition, it seemed
decidedly unconcerned with where it had been or where it was
going—exhibiting somehow simultaneously the confidence of the master and
the inexperience of the apprentice.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There is nothing more essential to the enjoyment of a civilized lunch
than to have a lively topic of conversation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Unlike adults, children want to be happy. So they still have the
ability to take the greatest pleasure in the simplest things.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Did he remember those days when his children were almost certainly
six? When there was a pitter-pat in the hallways an hour before dawn?
When every object smaller than an apple was nowhere to be found, until
it was right underfoot? When books went unread, letters unanswered, and
every train of thought was left incomplete?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“I gather you are an early riser, Alexander Ilyich,” he said after a
moment of silence. “Men of purpose usually are.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Every country has its grand canvas, the so-called masterpiece that
hangs in a hallowed hall and sums up the national identity for
generations to come. For the French it is Delacroix’s Liberty Leading
the People; for the Dutch, Rembrandt’s Night Watch; for the Americans,
Washington Crossing the Delaware; and for we Russians? It is a pair of
twins: Nikolai Ge’s Peter the Great Interrogating Alexei and Ilya
Repin’s Ivan the Terrible and His Son. For decades, these two paintings
have been revered by our public, praised by our critics, and sketched by
our diligent students of the arts. And yet, what do they depict? In one,
our most enlightened Tsar studies his oldest son with suspicion, on the
verge of condemning him to death; while in the other, unflinching Ivan
cradles the body of his eldest, having already exacted the supreme
measure with a swing of the scepter to the head.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A room is the summation of all that has happened inside it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It is the role of the parent to express his concerns and then take
three steps back. Not one, mind you, not two, but three. Or maybe four.
(But by no means five.) Yes, a parent should share his hesitations and
then take three or four steps back, so that the child can make a
decision by herself—even when that decision may lead to
disappointment.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What matters in life is not whether we receive a round of applause;
what matters is whether we have the courage to venture forth despite the
uncertainty of acclaim.</p>
