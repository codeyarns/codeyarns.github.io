by Noam Chomsky (4/5) – This is a compilation of op-eds by Noam Chomsky
written for <a href="http://www.nytsyn.com/">The New York Times
Syndicate</a>. And here’s the irony – supposedly the views in these
op-eds are such that US papers (including NYTimes itself) have declined
to publish them. However, they’ve been published widely in Guardian and
other non-US newspapers. The 44 op-eds in the book run from 2002 through
2006. Reading them I couldn’t even figure out why they weren’t printed
in the US. They didn’t seem offending or much different from his usual
writing.</p>
<p>The main topics of the op-eds are: * Iraq - US supported Saddam
against Iran. He and the country becomes enemy when oil becomes
important. * Israel/Palestine - US+Israel have been pushing down all
possible resolutions to the never ending conflict. In the UN, US+Israel
alone have been voting against policies which could help while the
entire rest of the world have voted for it. * South America - US screwed
the nations here destroying validly elected democracies and putting up
puppet presidents and dictatorships. The nations here have been moving
left-center in recent years with independent leaders who are
increasingly defiant to US. * Democracy - US bringing democracy to the
world is such a farce. They’ll support dictatorships, pull down
governments, run elections, and of course force democracy – basically do
anything required to maintain control. * Power - The only way to keep US
off your country is to develop/acquire nukes. See how they can destroy
Iraq while they can’t touch N Korea. * Policy - Chomsky and Sainath say
the same with regards to this issue. Public opinion no longer matters.
Public opinion doesn’t influence public policy even a bit. Special
interests, lobbies and big business run all the nation’s policies. *
Iran - It’s all about the control over oil honey.</p>
<p>Since these are op-eds written about current affairs, there is a lot
of repetition of ideas while you read them. Since the op-eds are all
byte-sized, the book is perfect to read over short breaks/commutes. Good
read.</p>
