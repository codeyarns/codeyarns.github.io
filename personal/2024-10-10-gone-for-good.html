<p>I felt refreshed returning to a murder mystery, <strong>Gone for
Good</strong> in our book club. Written by <strong>Joanna
Schaffhausen</strong>, this is the first in her <strong>Detective
Annalisa Vega</strong> series. We start off with our protagonist,
Chicago PD detective <em>Annalisa Vega</em>, assigned to a murder that
seems to be a copycat of 7 serial murders committed 20 years ago by the
<em>Lovelorn killer</em>. His macabre signature was to tie up his female
victims in the style of shibari and suffocate them to death. We soon
discover why the killer came out of the shadows after 20 long years -
his latest victim <em>Grace Harper</em> had been a part of a group of
amateur detectives called <em>Grave Diggers</em> and she had been close
to revealing his identity. This serial killer is not a stranger to Vega
too, since he had killed her neighbor <em>Kathy Duffy</em>, whose family
had been close to her. As the killer starts to get fatally close to
Vega, she is drawn between her two ex partners.</p>
<p>This book was engrossing and easy to finish in just two sittings. I
loved the setup, the settings in Chicago and the mystery of this serial
killer. Vega and her two lovers felt truly thin and out of place for
this plot. The chapters ping pong between the story and journal entries
by Grace Harper, this adds an extra point of view to the telling. The
third act was truly weak, with the ludicrous reveal of the killer and
the harebrained climax caper. It is somewhat salvaged by a truly
surprising twist at the end that shatters Vega’s family. Apparently the
books get better in this series, so I might be tempted to try a Vega
mystery again.</p>
<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 4/5</p>
