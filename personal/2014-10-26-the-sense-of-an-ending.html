<p>Some great experiences happen just by chance. So it was with the book
<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sense_of_an_Ending"><strong>The
Sense of an Ending</strong></a> by <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Barnes"><strong>Julian
Barnes</strong></a>. Saturday noon, I dropped by the library looking for
a book. I could not find it, but picked this one since the <a
href="http://essentialme.wordpress.com/">doctor</a> had it on his list
recently. The Mrs discovered a quiet reading room in the library and
wanted to spend the day there. It was actually pin-drop silent (no
electronic devices allowed), had luxurious seats and was filled with
folks who were reading quite seriously. I ended up having a fantastic
reading experience and was able to finish off most of the book in
literally one long sitting.</p>
<p>I like books and movies that focus on a few well fleshed-out
characters and details. This book was just that! It is two recollections
by the narrator. The first recollection is around his mid-20s. He
describes his high school life, his three close friends and his first
short-lived love after he joins university. The second recollection is
in his old age. He has had a marriage, a child and a divorce. Life comes
full circle and he is forced to mull over and act on his old memories
and the loose ends are quite tragically tied up.</p>
<p>After reading this book, I am kind of embarrassed that I had not
heard of Julian Barnes earlier. That is because the quality of writing
in this book is nothing short of fantastic. Especially the first part of
the book, which is just exceptional. There are many great passages that
you chew over, re-read and think of sharing later but give up since
there are so many of them. The characters are so well etched that they
remain memorable even after you are done with the book. The plot is
actually a bit weak, especially the ending. But boy can Barnes squeeze a
tale out of it! I ended up reminiscing a lot about my past life while
reading the book and many good novels do that to you.</p>
<p>The Sense of an Ending is a great read, a book I highly recommend. It
is also pretty short and since it is almost un-put-downable, can be
easily finished in a day. If you are looking for some brilliant
literature look no further.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/4</p>
