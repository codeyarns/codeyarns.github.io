<p>[ <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/paramount/startrek/">Trailer</a> ]</p>
<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 4/4 (Must see movie!)</p>
<p>You don't need to be a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trekkie">Trekkie</a> to watch and enjoy the new <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0796366/">Star Trek</a> movie. Directed by J. J. Abrams (of the incomparable Lost TV series fame), the movie is a fresh start in the Star Trek plot genealogy. On planet Earth, James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) is a playboy riding futuristic bikes (which sound far sexier than they look) and flirting with females in bars. A bar fight and a tryst with his dad's heroic death leads him to sign up for training at the <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starfleet_Academy">Starfleet Academy</a></em>. Meanwhile on planet Vulcan, Spock (Zachary Quinto) is an extremely intelligent progeny of a Vulcan dad and an Earth mother. Facing unfair treatment from his fellow Vulcans due to his mixed race, he grows up trading his emotions for pure logical thinking. The reckless unpredictable Kirk and the cool headed logician Spock are thrown together on the <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starship_Enterprise">USS Enterprise</a></em>, a new Starship which heads into trouble on its very first mission. Captain Nero (Eric Bana), a Romulan has travelled through time to avenge the destruction of his planet Romulus by Spock in the future. This fight against Nero will bring together Kirk and Spock with the rest of their legendary crew -- Leonard McCoy (Karl Urban), Sulu (John Cho), Chekov, Scott and the sexy Uhura (Zoe Saldana).</p>
<p>Star Trek is the most fun movie I've seen in a long time and is hands down the best movie this summer. The movie begs to be seen on the big screen. The jokes never stop rolling in due to the unending bickering between Kirk and Spock. Abrams has used time travel as a clever plot device to bring in old Spock (the legendary Leonard Nimoy) and explain the whole Star Trek story. Also, by placing the characters in a new timeline, Abrams sets himself free for changes in the coming movies without irking rabid fans of the old franchise. The cast of Star Trek really shines through. Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto fit their roles extremely well, especially Quinto who is able to totally overcome his evil Syler persona from the Hero TV series. Eric Bana is completely unrecognisable in his evil tattooed <em>mu-ha-ha</em> Nero avatar. Karl Urban is super affable, John Cho (the Harold from <em>Harold And Kumar Go To White Castle</em>) is funny and Zoe Saldana is a total looker. The plot is fast and the action never stops. You know a movie is entertaining when it ends and you <em>immediately</em> pang for its sequel. Star Trek is not to be missed!</p>
<p>I leave you with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulcan_salute">Vulcan salute</a>, &quot;Live long and prosper!&quot;</p>
