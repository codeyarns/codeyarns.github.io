<p>Notes from the several trips to San Francisco.</p>
<h2 id="in-and-around-pier-39-2022-and-2024">In and around Pier 39 (2022
and 2024)</h2>
<p>In the middle of the Bay Area heatwave of summer 2022, we decided to
cool off one day in SF.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Parking:</strong> Finding weekend street parking in SF is
near impossible and there is also a high chance of cars parked outside
being broken in. With this in mind, we booked a day-long parking spot <a
href="https://grs.lazparking.com/Widget/Simple/?l=49156&amp;wk=9b9e223e85b740fe842792655114db05">online</a>
at the Pier 39 parking garage (cost $20 in 2024). We arrived at the
garage around 10AM and found that it was already pretty full - so don’t
arrive too late. This garage is right in front of Pier 39, so it turned
out to be super convenient.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pier 39:</strong> The pier itself is a touristy place -
restaurants, shops selling trinkets. We saw sea lions sunning themselves
nearby and there is Alcatraz in the distance. Though the pier was empty
in the morning, it was super crowded when we returned back there in the
late afternoon.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>SS Jeremiah O’Brien:</strong> Strolling along the
seaside, we saw this WW2 supply ship that has now been converted to a
floating museum. It was fun to see the insides of the ship and the
Normandy beach diaroma was especially nice.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fisherman’s Wharf:</strong> Strolling further along the
seaside brings us to this other touristy place with seafood
restaurants.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cable cars:</strong> Strolling further along brought us
to the Hyde and Powell starting point for the cable cars. We bought
1-day passes on the <em>MuniMobile</em> app for both adults and kids
(cost $13 each). This is definitely one of the must-do things in SF.
Cutting through the hills of SF is such fun. Do note that the waiting
line for the ride back from Market St was super long (more than an
hour).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Food:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Chowder Hut:</strong> Decent fish sandwiches, but good
ambience of Fisherman’s Wharf.</li>
<li><strong>Kennedy’s Indian Curry House and Irish Pub:</strong> No
frills, affordable prices, good portion sizes, good tasting Indian grub
and a super nice waiter. Order at the computer at the entrance, grab a
table and food will be brought to your table. Note that the place is a
bit old and run down.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Warnings:</strong> Even though we were strolling along
these touristy places in the middle of a weekend day, SF’s
homeless/drugged/nude people were visible occasionally. And filth could
be seen in some places. Especially when with kids, be prepared for
difficult questions.</p></li>
</ul>
