<p><strong>The Terminal</strong> had been on my to-watch list for a long
time now after I read about the guy who has been actually stuck in an
airport for years. Tom Hanks plays Viktor Navorski, a guy from the
(fictional) country Krakozhia. As soon as Viktor lands in JFK airport, a
coup happens in his home country and his passport is invalidated. He is
left stranded in the airport with no option to either get out to America
or to return back home. The film follows him through his next 9 months
(!) in the airport. He slowly learns English, makes friends with the
airport staff and even falls in love with an airhostess (Catherine
Zeta-Jones). All ends well, when after months, his country’s government
returns to normalcy and he is allowed to go back home.</p>
<p>The movie is directed by Spielberg. Tom Hanks is good in the movie.
His East European accent is enjoyable. Catherine Zeta-Jones looks
charming. The movie is fun, but comes off as a tad unreal in many
places.</p>
