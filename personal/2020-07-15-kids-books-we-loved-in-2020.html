<h1 class="title">Kids’ books we loved in 2020</h1>

<p>We buy books to read for our son and also borrow a ton of books from
the local library. There are only a few which stick and turn out to be
favorites of our kid. Surprisingly, most of the recommended books like
Goodnight Moon, We’re Going on a Bear Hunt or a ton of Dr. Seuss books
were all unpopular at home. Listed below are the books that we were a
hit with our 5-year old this year.</p>
<h2
id="amar-chitra-katha-panchatantra-hitopadesha-and-jataka-tales">Amar
Chitra Katha: Panchatantra, Hitopadesha and Jataka Tales</h2>
<p>This is a collection of 23 <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amar_Chitra_Katha">ACK</a> comic
books, each a compilation of themed stories from each of the
Panchatantra, Hitopadesha or Jataka tales. I liked that the stories in
each book have a common writer and illustrator. These books are meant
for older kids, but we read out these stories to our kid and he likes
looking at the pictures while we do that.</p>
<p>I have great childhood memories of ACK, which I why I got these books
for my son. But to be honest, many of the stories here have not aged
well. A lot of the societal and cultural themes in several of the
stories may not be appropriate in this day and age. Things like caste
hierarchy and gender bias pervade the stories involving humans, while
the animal stories might have lots of gore.</p>
<h2 id="berenstain-bears"><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berenstain_Bears">Berenstain
Bears</a></h2>
<p>We discovered this series of ~600 illustrated short books featuring a
bear family at the local library. These were created by a couple named
Stan and Jan Berenstain, starting in 1962, also lending their last name
to their books. The stories in these books revolve around a bear family,
which has a papa, mama, a son, a daughter and a baby. The books start
out with only the first three and the other kids are added in later
books. A typical story involves the father or the mother leading the
family confidently but blundering along the way, usually losing
miserably, which make this fun to read to my kid. The pictures are warm
and cozy and the prose has a nice rhyme, so the whole package is
great.</p>
<p>Books we liked reading:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Big Honey Hunt (1962): Papa Bear sets out with Small Bear
claiming to know how to find honey in the wild, but returns
defeated.</li>
<li>The Bears’ Picnic (1966): Papa Bear sets out with family claiming to
know how to find the perfect picnic spot, but returns home
defeated.</li>
<li>The Bears’ Vacation (1968): Papa Bear claims to teach Small Bear all
the rules of a beach vacation, while blundering through the
process.</li>
<li>The Berenstain Bears’ Family Reunion</li>
<li>The Berenstain Bears’ Big Machines</li>
<li>The Berenstain Bears’ Seashore Treasure</li>
</ul>
<p>Many of the books in the series do not have a story, these are
usually the ones we did not like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inside, Outside, Upside Down (1968)</li>
<li>Bears on Wheels (1969)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="greek-myths"><a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Greek-Myths-Marcia-Williams/dp/0763653845/">Greek
Myths</a></h2>
<p>Towards the middle of the year I realized that I knew very little
about Greek mythological stories and characters. I used my son’s
constant demands for bedtime stories as a forcing function to go through
a lot of Greek myth books that both kids and adults could enjoy. The
book that we ended up laughing, discussing and falling asleep to for
many months was this picture book by <strong>Marcia
Williams</strong>.</p>
<p>This book has all the important Greek myths and characters in a
humorous comic book format. The humor is of the cheesy juvenile type,
which was perfect for our kid, but also destroyed that high-brow feel of
these myths and showed them for what they are - great stories.</p>
<h2 id="fly-guy">Fly Guy</h2>
<p>This is a series of easy-to-read picture books featuring a fly who
lives with a kid. Written by <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tedd_Arnold">Tedd Arnold</a> this is
yet another adolescent humor that our kid snickers about while we read
it to him.</p>
<h2 id="dog-man"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_Man">Dog
Man</a></h2>
<p>And finally, the award for the most popular book at our home this
year goes to <strong>Dog Man</strong>! This series of 9 graphic novels
by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dav_Pilkey">Dav Pilkey</a>
(famous for <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Underpants"><strong>Captain
Underpants</strong></a>) are full of cheesy juvenile humor, the kind
that a 5-year old brat would holler about. Initially, our son wanted us
to read the speech bubbles while he enjoyed the drawings. But the
drawings were simple enough that he soon enough he started flipping
through the pages himself and understand the story without having to
reading text. The special <em>fliporama</em> pages and the <em>how to
draw</em> sections at the back of the books also were hits. Our kid
started to make simple comic books featuring the Dog Man characters
influenced by these books. Stuck at home all year due to COVID, our son
truly found a hero we can all bark about. We are eagerly awaiting the
upcoming books from this series.</p>
