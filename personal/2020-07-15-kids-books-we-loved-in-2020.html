<p>This list is solely created from the books we read to our 4-year old son.</p>
<h2 id="amar-chitra-katha-panchatantra-hitopadesha-and-jataka-tales">Amar Chitra Katha: Panchatantra, Hitopadesha and Jataka Tales</h2>
<p>This is a collection of 23 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amar_Chitra_Katha">ACK</a> comic books, each a compilation of themed stories from each of the Panchatantra, Hitopadesha or Jataka tales. I liked that the stories in each book have a common writer and illustrator. These books are meant for older kids, but we read out these stories to our kid and he likes looking at the pictures while we do that.</p>
<p>I have great childhood memories of ACK, which I why I got these books for my son. But to be honest, many of the stories here have not aged well. A lot of the societal and cultural themes in several of the stories may not be appropriate in this day and age. Things like caste hierarchy and gender bias pervade the stories involving humans, while the animal stories might have lots of gore.</p>
<h2 id="berenstain-bears"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berenstain_Bears">Berenstain Bears</a></h2>
<p>We discovered this series of ~600 illustrated short books featuring a bear family at the local library. These were created by a couple named Stan and Jan Berenstain, starting in 1962, also lending their last name to their books. The stories in these books revolve around a bear family, which has a papa, mama, a son, a daughter and a baby. The books start out with only the first three and the other kids are added in later books. A typical story involves the father or the mother leading the family confidently but blundering along the way, usually losing miserably, which make this fun to read to my kid. The pictures are warm and cozy and the prose has a nice rhyme, so the whole package is great.</p>
<p>Books we liked reading:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Big Honey Hunt (1962): Papa Bear sets out with Small Bear claiming to know how to find honey in the wild, but returns defeated.</li>
<li>The Bears' Picnic (1966): Papa Bear sets out with family claiming to know how to find the perfect picnic spot, but returns home defeated.</li>
<li>The Bears' Vacation (1968): Papa Bear claims to teach Small Bear all the rules of a beach vacation, while blundering through the process.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many of the books in the series do not have a story, these are usually the ones we did not like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inside, Outside, Upside Down (1968)</li>
<li>Bears on Wheels (1969)</li>
</ul>
