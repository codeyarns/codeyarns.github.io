<p>India is everywhere today on the literary landscape. I was surprised
to see a copy of <a href="2006-12-31-the-hills-of-angheri.html">The
Hills Of Angheri</a> in the National University of Singapore bookshop
this week! Now here comes <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corridor_%28graphic_novel%29"><strong>Corridor</strong></a>
written and drawn by <strong>Sarnath Banerjee</strong> which claims to
be India’s first graphic novel. V was kind enough to borrow it for me
through <a href="http://www.nlb.gov.sg/">NLB</a>.</p>
<p>Corridor is all urban, and mostly male. All the characters in its
social network are connected to one central person, Jehangir
Rangoonwalla, who is more of a philosophy dispenser than a second hand
book seller, which happens to be his profession. Brighu is an obsessive
collector of <em>things</em> and is currently pondering whether to
settle down with his girlfriend Kali. Digital Dutta thinks about his
H1-B visa during the day while at night Karl Marx advises him to use his
knowledge to help the poor. Shintu is newly married and is on the search
for an aphrodisiac to enhance his pleasure at night. There are no
beginnings, no conclusions, life continues on through the corridors of
Delhi. Sarnath doesn’t say it, but the novel seems
semi-autobiographical. Brighu’s story is definitely that of the author
himself, and the ending pages confirm that.</p>
<p>Corridor required 2 readings for complete satisfaction. At the first
read you notice the characters, the clever puns all over the place and
above all the complete Indian urbanity in the strips. But due to the
non-linear storytelling, a second read was needed to get in order the
jigsaw pieces of the characters’ lives. Though Corridor disappoints a
little with the way plots are tied together, Sarnath blows the reader’s
mind with the details. He’s got everything spot on, the urban landscape
of Delhi and Kolkata, the characters, the language and the weather.
Humour of the sarcastic/ironic kind is in every page. The novel reeks
with an unique Indianness I’ve never seen used before in comics (not
like there are many books in this genre anyway). Moral science charts
from our youth (How to be <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/Ideal-Boy-Charts-Sirish-Rao/dp/1899235833/">an
ideal boy</a>), clichéd Bollywood scenes, bound volumes of Phantom
comics, the healing power of Gelusil and the quintessential autorickshaw
driver dozing the noon away in his back-seat, all find a way to
unobtrusively lodge themselves into the strips and story. The art and
letters are all hand drawn, looks like computers have never touched it
during the process. This is actually good since it has that rough,
amateur feel to it. A few pages in the book are colored in, the rest is
black-n-white. The book is 112 pages long. I was surprised it took a
couple of hours to read through this tiny book of comic strips. That is
a testament to the amount of detail Sarnath has squeezed into each box.
I call this a must read for any Indian who grew up in a city.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/4</p>
