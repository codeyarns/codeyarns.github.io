href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L.A._Confidential_%28film%29"><strong>L.A.
Confidential</strong></a> is a film noir set in Los Angeles of the
1950s. The story peeks at the shady connections between the police, the
tabloid press, the drug network, the movie industry and the prostitution
ring in the city. The principal heroes are three police officers of
different shades: Guy Pearce is a rule-follower wanting to climb the
ranks, Russell Crowe is highly temperamental and Kevin Spacey is after
fame and glamour. Lest I forget there is Kim Basinger as a prostitute
who charms the hearts of both Crowe and Pearce. A mysterious carnage at
the Night Owl cafe and the hunt for the killers brings them together,
inspite of their mutual hatred, and they discover a malaise in their
department that runs deeper than they can fathom.</p>
<p>The movie could have very well been created by the hands of Frank
Miller, it flows and looks veritably like Sin City. The plot is juicy,
and is based on the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L.A._Confidential">book of the same
name</a> by James Ellroy. The main characters have all acted well, with
a cast that includes Russell Crowe and Kevin Spacey, that is hardly
surprising. But, especially notable is Guy Pearce, who I am not familiar
with. Though quite long at 2+ hours, L.A. Confidential is an engaging
dark fable.</p>
