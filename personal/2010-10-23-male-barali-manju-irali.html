<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 1/4 (With nothing redeemable about it, Male Barali Manju Irali is a poor creation that should be avoided.)</p>
<p><strong>Male Barali Manju Irali</strong> (ಮಳೆ ಬರಲಿ ಮಂಜೂ ಇರಲಿ) is a 2009 Kannada romantic drama written and directed by Vijayalakshmi Singh. The movie stars Parvathy Menon, Sreenagara Kitty and Naga Kiran in a romantic triangle. Parvathy returns to a mist filled estate of Madikeri to meet her dad on her vacation. Her dad works at the estate, whose owner has two sons Kitty and Kiran. Parvathy falls in love with the elder brother Kitty, while the younger brother Kiran falls in love with her. Kiran sacrifices his love for his brother, while an old lover of Kitty returns back to marry him leaving Parvathy in a dilemma.</p>
<p>The only watchable aspect of <strong>Male Barali Manju Irali</strong> is the beautiful rain and mist filled scenes of Coorg. The movie is all round disappointing. Dealing with a well worn story, Singh does not add anything to make the plot interesting. Choreography, editing and music, all are poor. Parvathy Menon is just as watchable as she was in <strong><a href="http://moviemaathu.wordpress.com/2010/09/05/milana/">Milana</a></strong>, and the two heroes give decent performances. Jai Jagadish, the real-life husband of Singh, is in the role of Parvathy's dad. Singh makes a cameo appearance in the beginning of the movie, standing beside Parvathy at a busstop. With nothing redeemable about it, <strong>Male Barali Manju Irali</strong> is a poor creation that should be avoided.</p>
