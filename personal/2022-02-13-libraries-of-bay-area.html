<h1 class="title">Libraries of Bay Area</h1>

<p>Getting a library card is literally the first thing I do when I move to a new place! The libraries in the San Francisco Bay Area are not as accessible as I was used to in Singapore. But I found that there are enough of them to placate me.</p>
<h2 id="milpitas-community-library-milpitas">Milpitas Community Library (Milpitas)</h2>
<p>This is the only library for the small city of Milpitas. I love the interiors of this 2-story libary for its modern style, bright sunlight and great kids section.</p>
<p>It is part of the <strong>Santa Clara Country Library District</strong>, which covers the smaller cities of the county, which don’t have their own libraries. (The Santa Clara <em>city</em> has its own libraries.)</p>
<p>The collections are modest and the members seem to be voracious readers. There is zero chance of finding the latest copy of any magazine. Thankfully, the library district also allows borrowing digital copies of the magazines.</p>
<p>The one disadvantage of this (and all libraries of its district) is that they are <em>not</em> members of the <a href="2019-02-17-the-awesome-link-library-service.html">LINK+ service</a>.</p>
<h2 id="central-park-library-santa-clara">Central Park Library (Santa Clara)</h2>
<p>This is the central and biggest library in Santa Clara city. The building is beautiful inside and the collections are great. The kids collection and seating area is especially good. There is also a simple cafe inside to grab a quick drink or bite.</p>
<p>The library is inside the Central Park of the city and so it is great to take a stroll here before or after the library visit.</p>
<p>The library also used to host the annual Comic Con of the city, which our son used to love.</p>
<p>This is also the library which I used for writing parts of my last book.</p>
<h2 id="northside-branch-library-santa-clara">Northside Branch Library (Santa Clara)</h2>
<p>This is a small and modern branch library of the <strong>Santa Clara City Library</strong>. I lived nearby for 4 years and having a library at walking distance was a huge win for us. Nearly every weekend morning would find us relaxing in this library with our son.</p>
<p>The adult collection is pretty limited here, but the kids collection is ample. The kids area has a nice seating for kids and parents to sit and play with.</p>
<p>This is also the library which I used for writing parts of my last book.</p>
