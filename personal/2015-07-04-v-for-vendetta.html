<p>The reason <strong>The Dark Knight</strong> is an epic film to me is
not Christian Bale’s <strong>Batman</strong>, but Heath Ledger’s
eponymous <strong>Joker</strong>. It is hard to call him a classic
villain since he is the one who asks the hard questions and creates
interesting moral dilemmas. It is that Joker I was repeatedly reminded
of in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V_for_Vendetta"><strong>V
for Vendetta</strong></a>, the now-famous graphic novel from the duo of
<strong>Alan Moore</strong> and <strong>David Lloyd</strong>. Published
in 1988, it depicts a grim totalitarian regime in the near future of
1997 for England. There is a <strong>Leader</strong> who keeps a tight
lid on the citizens in Big Brother style using CCTV, phone tapping,
propaganda and police, creatively named the Eye, Ear, Mouth and Finger
departments. Starting from Guy Fawkes Day of that year, a mysterious
vigilante saves an innocent girl from the regime’s henchmen, starts
killing the regime’s leaders and bombing their centers in London. Thus
begins a cat and mouse game between the regime that is hell-bent on
catching the killer and he in destroying their grip over the people.</p>
<p>Much like in <a
href="2008-10-20-watchmen.html"><strong>Watchmen</strong></a>, Alan
Moore’s vision of a dystopian world, its rulers and the character of
<strong>V</strong> in a Guy Fawkes costume is brilliant. David Lloyd’s
art is fantastic, with most panels in dark shadows, conveying the
depressing mood of the story. The coloring is a letdown though,
reminding me of cheap comics. This might be technical issue, maybe good
inking was expensive or unavailable to the creators? The novel is
divided into 3 books, with the first two being quite riveting. It is the
last book that was disappointing. In this climactic stretch, the plot
literally flails around tied to a V who turns out to be increasingly
psychotic. The Leader too is weakened in an unbelievably lame manner.
More troubling is how lackadaisical the plot is to the plight of a
society which falls into full blown anarchy.</p>
<p>The version of V for Vendetta I read had a section at the end where
Alan Moore explains candidly how he and David Lloyd came about to create
the story, characters and art of this novel. It was quite refreshing to
learn that even for masters like this duo, creation is a very messy and
confusing process where slowly enough things stick to the wall and take
shape. The book also had various draft sketches and artwork created for
this series. This section is a must read, if you ever pick up this
book.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 3/4</p>
<p><strong>ISBN:</strong> 9781401208417</p>
<p><strong>Excerpts:</strong></p>
<p>The Leader justifies his rule:</p>
<blockquote>
The Romans invented fascism. A bundle of bound twigs was its symbol. One
twig could be broken. A bundle would prevail. Fascism … strength in
unity. I believe in strength. I believe in unity. And if that strength,
that unity of purpose, demands a uniformity of thought, word and deed
then so be it. I will not hear talk of freedom. I will not hear talk of
individual liberty. They are luxuries. I do not believe in luxuries. The
war put paid to luxury. The war put paid to freedom.
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
Authority, when first detecting chaos at its heels, will entertain the
vilest schemes to saves its orderly facade. But always order without
justice, without love or liberty, which cannot long postpone their
world’s descent into pandemonium. Authority allows two roles: the
torturer and the tortured; twists people into joyless mannequins that
fear and hate, while culture plunges into the abyss.
</blockquote>
