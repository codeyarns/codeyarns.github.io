<p>Sabrina: Suppose you meet someone on the boat, the first day? A perfect stranger. Linus: I have a better suppose, Sabrina. Suppose I were ten years younger and you weren’t in love with David. Suppose I asked you to … I suppose I’m just talking nonsense. Sabrina: I suppose so.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I watched the original B&amp;W version of the movie Sabrina today. Sabrina (Audrey Hepburn) is a chauffeur’s daughter who has a huge crush on David (William Holden), the younger brother of Linus (Humphrey Bogart), a business tycoon. David doesn’t care for Sabrina, is a flirt and already has been through 3 marriages. Sabrina goes away to Paris to study cooking and comes back 2 years later with a new mod look. David falls for her and in the process hampers his engagement and a mega business merger between his and his fiancé’s businesses. Linus, the “cold businessman with ice water in his veins and a ticker tape coming from his heart” shrewdly tries to separate them, but ends up falling in love with Sabrina.</p>
<p>This movie was remade in the 90s with Harrison Ford and the lovely Julia Ormond and I liked that version better. The scenes from Paris in that movie were just too lovely! But, this original version has a tighter story and there’s Hepburn. Bogart is (like always) way too old for Hepburn! The dialogues are clever and perky. A good romantic watch.</p>
