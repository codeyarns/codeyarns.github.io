<p>All these years I had stayed away from <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Tolstoy"><strong>Tolstoy</strong></a>
due to the sheer size of his tomes. I was convinced by a friend to pick
up what is probably his smallest book <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_of_Ivan_Ilyich"><strong>The
Death of Ivan Ilyich</strong></a>. We begin immediately after the death
of judge Ivan Ilyich is published in the papers and his friends at the
court are already thinking of how they could benefit from his vacancy
behind the desk. His friend <em>Pyotr Ivanovich</em> grudgingly realizes
he has to go to the wake because everyone knows how close he was to the
demised. At the home, the widow <em>Praskovya Fyodorovna</em> expresses
her grief, but actually wants to learn how the family could earn the
most pension possible from Ivan’s death. We then learn about Ivan’s
life, as a middle child who took after his father’s law career, was just
and uncorrupt, but also focused on furthering his career as much as
possible. He falls in love and marries and life is content until marital
discords and disagreements start after the birth of their first child.
He decides to focus even more on his career progression and ends up as a
judge and moves his family to a grand estate. An injury at home slowly
grows into a painful illness that gnaws away at his life. Doctor after
doctor poke and prod at him, offer medicines, but nothing works as he
grows frail and sick. In the end he is stuck in bed until his eventual
death, observing how his family and friends continue with their lives
and no one seems to understand his predicament.</p>
<p>This turned out to be a fantastic book. Never having read Tolstoy
before, I was struck by his literary style. He is able to observe the
human and social condition and express it in ways and from points of
view I have never experienced before. And the writing, even through this
English translation by <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynn_Solotaroff"><strong>Lynn
Solotaroff</strong></a>, knocks you so hard! Long winding sentences
filled with memorable expressions, that you end up reading them over and
over again, making a note that you will return to this book to find that
perfect sentence when that condition in life inevitably occurs. (This
particular edition I read had an introduction which was 30 pages long!
Yes, a 30 page intro to a 90 page story - which is why I always skip
those.) A highly recommended gem of a book and a great way to get into
Tolstoy.</p>
<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 5/5</p>

<h2 id="excerpts">Excerpts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Visit to a doctor</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The waiting, and the pomp on entry, a charade played out by the
doctor and familiar to him because it was the same as he recognized in
himself in court, the tapping, and the listening, the questions
requiring preordained and self-evidently futile replies, and the
meaningful look which proclaimed, come, come sir, just rely on us and
we’ll sort it all out—we know perfectly well how to settle matters, one
way will do for all, whoever they may be. It was all exactly as it was
in court. Just as he put on a show in court for the man on trial, so the
doctor put on a show for him.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Ivan Ilyich suffered most of all from lies—the lie that everyone
accepted, for some reason, that he was just ill, not dying, that he need
only keep calm and take his medicine and something splendid would come
of it. And he knew that whatever the medicines might do, nothing would
come of it except more agonizing misery and death. He found this lie
insufferable; he was tormented by the fact that nobody wanted to admit
what he knew—what everyone knew—but chose to lie to him about his
dreadful state. They wanted, even forced him to participate in the same
lie. Lying—the lie inflicted on him on the eve of his death, the lie
which was bound to degrade the fearful, solemn scene of his death to the
level of all those visits, curtains, and sturgeons for dinner . . . this
was a dreadful affliction for Ivan Ilyich. And—it was strange—many times
when they were doing their stuff over him, he was within a whisker of
shouting at them, “Stop lying! You know and I know I’m dying, at least
you could stop lying to me.” But he never had the spirit to do so.</li>
