<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0311113/">Master And Commander:
The Far Side Of The World</a> is an action adventure on the sea based on
the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aubrey%E2%80%93Maturin_series">Aubrey-Maturin</a>
series of novels by Patrick O’Brian. It is set aboard the warship
<em>HMS Surprise</em> captained by Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe). Set in
1805, during the time of the Napoleonic wars, Aubrey is on orders to
fight and destroy French warships. Along with him in the ship is his
close friend, ship doctor and naturalist Stephen Maturin. Surprise
clashes with a much younger and stronger French ship and are beaten in
two fights. But, in the last and third one, they pull a surprise and
defeat the French.</p>
<p>This movie is absolutely fabulous to watch, a treat on the senses!
Director Peter Weir has recreated life aboard a ship so naturally, like
I have never seen before. Every single object, detail and activity is
lucid and draws the eye. The acting is excellent to say the least.
Russell Crowe as Aubrey and Paul Bettany (remember Nash’s imaginary
friend in The Beautiful Mind?) as the ship doctor are superb. More than
the battles, the movie delights when it depicts the day-to-day running
of a ship. The strategies that Aubrey as a captain has to think of! How
cool and composed he is as a captain! I was amazed by the amount of
command and control needed to run a ship. Also, Maturin is a naturalist,
a character whose journeys in this movie strongly resemble that of
Charles Darwin on his epic <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_voyage_of_HMS_Beagle">HMS
Beagle voyage</a>. This movie is a gem in every sense! Go watch it.</p>
<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 4/4 (A gem, must see!)</p>
