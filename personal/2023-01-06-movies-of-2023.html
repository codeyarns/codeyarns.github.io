<p>I chose this just for Chevy Chase, who I liked in the National Lampoon movies. Here he is a smartass LA reporter investigating drugs on the beach and a mysterious contract to kill a rich businessman. The plot is somewhat interesting, but didn’t seem to align well with the movie’s attempt to make it funny. It is just watchable, because of Chase.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 2/4</p>

<p>Daniel Craig seems to have landed in a great post-Bond career as private detective Benoit Blanc. I much enjoyed his second outing as Blanc in the <strong>Glass Onion</strong> and decided to check out this first one. Here we have an Agatha Christie-like murder mystery at the estate of a famous murder mystery author who has committed suicide. The plot was supremely entertaining, funny and nail biting. I had a great time trying to figure out who amongst the family was the real murderer. This is a must watch, about the same quality as a good Keigo Higashino mystery.</p>
