<p><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirate_Latitudes"><strong>Pirate
Latitudes</strong></a> is supposedly the last book by <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Crichton"><strong>Michael
Crichton</strong></a>, published in 2009 after his death. The story is
set in the 1600s around the islands and seas of Jamiaca and is
essentially the quest of British privateer Charles Hunter to take his
ship and men to defeat and steal the gold of the Spanish. We begin with
James Almont, the British governor of Jamaica learning that looted gold
is being held in a galleon docked at the Spanish island of Matanceros.
He entrusts Hunter to build up a crew and plot an impossible plan to
defeat the notorious Cazalla, who controls Matanceros. Hunter
meticulously picks his crew, preps his ship and attacks the island
ingeniously. When they survive and return to Jamaica with the gold-laden
ship, they discover that Almont’s secretary Hacklett has taken control
and is waiting to execute them.</p>
<p>Much like any Crichton book, it is super easy to read this book. It
is a joy to get pulled into and get lost in the historical and nautical
setting of this story. It is set in the golden age of sailing ships,
cannons, pirates, colonial gold and tropical islands and what’s not to
love about that?! The book has the feel of an entertaining summer
blockbuster and that is not such a bad thing.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 3/4</p>
