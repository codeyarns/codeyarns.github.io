<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0383216/">The Pink Panther</a> which released this year is a reboot of the Pink Panther series (in the vein of Casino Royale and the Bond series). I haven’t seen the previous movies, this was my first PP movie. Steve Martin stars as Jacques Clouseau, the most incompetent policeman in France. The coach of the French soccer team is murdered and his Pink Panther diamond is stolen. The Chief Inspector wants to solve this case and get the honours. Before that he wants to put a bumbling inspector onto the case, let him fail and then reveal his success. He chooses Clouseau as the guinea pig for this case. Clouseau takes the case seriously, but goes around trying to solve the case stupidly. He is helped by his beautiful secretary Nicole (Emily Mortimer) and a detective (Jean Reno). In the end, he does solve the case (obviously!) and turns out to be not as stupid as he seems.</p>
<p>I can’t compare the movie to its predecessors, but it was a pretty decent comedy. I know the original series is full of innuendoes, this one has next to none and is very tame. Beyoncé stars in the movie as the coach’s love interest and one of the prime suspects. Steve Martin trying to speak English in an excessive French accent doesn’t seem natural. This is just a good watch.</p>
