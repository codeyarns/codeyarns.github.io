<p><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Valley_of_Fear"><strong>The
Valley of Fear</strong></a> is the fourth and last <strong>Sherlock
Holmes</strong> novel, one that I had not read before. <strong>Arthur
Conan Doyle</strong> sets up a satisfying and familiar murder for Holmes
to solve in the first half. The owner of a moated mansion has been blown
to bits by a shotgun. The bridge over the moat around the house was
drawn up and closed during the grisly act. Who is the murderer? Why did
he murder and how did he escape unnoticed? A thrilling tale unravels as
Holmes and Watson find the threads leading to the crook.</p>
<p>The second half of the book though is a tad disappointing. Even after
the murderer is caught, Doyle pursues with his back-story. That follows
an arc familiar from <a
href="2014-07-28-a-study-in-scarlet.html"><strong>A Study in
Scarlet</strong></a>: going back to a time when America was being
explored. In the dark coal mining valley of <strong>Vermissa</strong>
are a secret brotherhood who threaten and kill people to extract money.
This murder emerges from a long vengeance from there that follows
through across the pond to England. Doyle is an excellent storyteller,
but it would have been nice to have a longer mystery without all the
back-story. <strong>Rating:</strong> 3/4</p>
<p><strong>ISBN:</strong> 0241952972</p>
