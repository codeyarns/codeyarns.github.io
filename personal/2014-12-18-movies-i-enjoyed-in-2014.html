<h1 class="title">Movies I enjoyed in 2014</h1>

<p>2014 was quite a disappointing year with the movies. I saw about 70
movies this year, about one or two every weekend. Though I avoided the
obvious duds, still only a handful turned out to be truly enjoyable. I
did not call this a Top or Best list since those add unnecessary
connotations to the listed items. Instead, these are the movies that I
thoroughly enjoyed and can see myself watching again in the future. The
list is way shorter compared to <a
href="2013-12-15-best-movies-of-2013.html">last year</a>, since I felt
that a lot of the supposed best of Hollywood/Bollywood were quite
average.</p>

<p>Director Lixin Fan follows one migrant worker family in China over
several years during their Chinese New Year vacation. The viewer gets to
see firsthand the social pressures, rapidly evolving cultures and
changing aspirations of the couple and their growing children. I love
the work of Lixin Fan and his earlier Up The Yangtze was one of the best
movies I saw in 2012. (See <a href="2012-04-15-up-the-yangtze.html">my
review</a> of that.)</p>

<p>My first Satyajit Ray movie and I am impressed. 50 years after its
release, the movie is watchable and its issues are still pertinent.
Observe how a family and the personality of its members evolves when the
husband loses his job and his wife gets a job to support them. Every
aspect is done to perfection.</p>

<p>Another gem from Studio Ghibli. Guaranteed to bring back memories of
simpler times, simpler places, childhood innocence and all that we lost
in becoming adults.</p>

<p>Anurag Kashyap’s cinematic gem set in the badlands of UP and Bihar.
The characters, the settings, the swears, the crimes, everything stays
with you long after the movie is gone. Part 2 was a bit disappointing
though since it rehashed a similar story.</p>

<p>Nothing like any Hindi movie I’ve seen before. Ridiculous, brilliant
and filled with in-jokes. Hope I get to see more of these from
Bollywood.</p>

<p>Kangana is honest, innocent and terribly funny in this European
caper. Several of the songs from this movie are on my playlist.</p>

<p>The protagonist comes to terms with her first love across many years
of her life. Beautifully acted and the French countryside is gorgeous
through the seasons. Loved Lola Créton in this.</p>

<p>I know it is cheesy and quite obviously I am heavily biased since it
is my city. But there is a spark, sensitivity and modernity in Anjali
Menon’s work that is sorely missing in similar movies.</p>
