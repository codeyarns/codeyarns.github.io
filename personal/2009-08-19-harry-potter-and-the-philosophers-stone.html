<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 4/4 (A great start to a magical journey!)</p>
<p>I started on <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Philosopher%27s_Stone">Harry Potter And The Philosopher’s Stone</a></em> having decided that I should reread the entire Harry Potter series before the release of the final 2 movies (which are based on the last book.) Though I had read this book a long time ago, it turned out to be a refreshing experience thanks to the ravages of time on my memory and the influence of the Harry Potter movies on my imagination. J. K. Rowling opens the book with the aftermath of a calamity in the world of magic. Voldemort, the super villain wizard has been vanquished while trying to kill infant Harry Potter. Harry is left to grow in the human (<em>muggle</em>) world at his uncle’s home, where he is subjected to years of bad treatment. Finally, when he comes of age, he is invited to the world of magic to study at <em>Hogwarts</em>, the school of magic. At Hogwarts, Harry forms strong friendships with Hermione and Ron. He studies the various forms of magic, learns to fly, to play the wizard sport of <em>Quidditch</em> and has plenty of adventures. Finally, the search for a secret <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosopher%27s_stone">philosopher’s stone</a> pits Harry against his nemesis Voldemort in an epic battle.</p>

<p>I love beginnings, both in books and movies. Harry Potter And The Philosopher’s Stone is a delightful read, for the dreamy world of magic and wizards it throws open to the reader. Rowling shows great finesse in creating compelling characters like Harry, Hermione, Ron, Dumbledore and Snape. The school aspects of the book remind me of the <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malory_Towers">Malory Towers</a></em> and <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Clare%27s_series">St. Clare’s</a></em> series of books by Enid Blyton. In her own unique approachable style, Rowling explores aspects of justice, fairness, racism and discrimination in the book. Now that I know what happens in the later books in this series, it is quite satisfying to note the various plot elements that Rowling has thrown into her first book for later use. (<em>Scabbers</em>, the strangely behaving mouse owned by Ron is one example.) The book is a short quick read (I was left wishing it was longer) and is full of humour from cover to cover. Though written for children, the book was a great read and I am eagerly looking forward to rereading the rest of the series.</p>
<p>A bit of trivia:</p>
<blockquote>
“Draco Dormiens Nunquam Titillandus”, the Latin motto seen below the Hogwarts coat of arms (seen on the title page of the book) means “Never tickle a sleeping dragon” ;-)
