<p><a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0386032/">Sicko</a> (5/5) -- This is Michael Moore's latest documentary about the state of American healthcare and health insurance. So, yes, the world's richest country doesn't treat its poor. Not just the poor, even people with health insurance are denied healthcare and asked to pay up. And drugs are exorbitantly priced. I believe this movie is a must watch even if you hate Moore.</p>
<p>I've seen the former movies of Moore, this is easily his best. There is none of the patched up storyline, confused flow or the pathetic editing. Supposedly, Moore was so afraid that the healthcare lobby might prevent screening of his movie that he subvertly leaked it. Whatever, the movie's all over Bittorrent, you should be able to get it <a href="http://btjunkie.org/search?q=sicko">easily</a>.</p>
