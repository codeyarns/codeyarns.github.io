<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 4/4 (A thrilling followup to <em>The Philosopher's Stone</em>)</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Chamber_of_Secrets"><em>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</em></a> is the second title in the Harry Potter series where Harry returns to Hogwarts for his second year of study. The plot structure of the book is almost the same as the first one, only darker. Much like the first book, a secret that is hidden away inside Hogwarts is revealed pretty early on (i.e., <em>The Chamber of Secrets</em>). J. K. Rowling shows some confidence and ups the gore factor for her series a bit here with several near-deaths (called <em>petrification</em>) and writings in blood. If I were a kid, I would be thrilled and scared reading this book! :-)</p>
<p>The most interesting plot device is Tom Riddle, the top student from Slytherin who would go on to become Lord Voldemort. Introducing him, Rowling mixes into the story the idea that Harry and his nemesis are very much alike. They both are brilliant, like to break rules, learn new tricks, can speak to snakes, and even the Sorting Hat had selected them both for Slytherin. The similarity of the hero and the villain, or put another way the thin line between good and evil is probably one of the strongest plot ideas in fiction (ever), which will never lose its appeal. Memorable is how Dumbledore solaces Harry about this:</p>
<blockquote>
&quot;It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.&quot;
</blockquote>

<p><em>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</em> is a good followup to <a href="http://fishmoth.wordpress.com/2009/08/19/harry-potter-and-the-philosophers-stone/"><em>The Philosopher's Stone</em></a>. The plot is gripping, even though I was not reading it for the first time. Maybe the only gripe I have with this book is that it is a bit too much similar to the first one. Thankfully, Rowling does not repeat that mistake with her later books.</p>
