<p>In today’s society and media, there are still many topics that are
taboo, with <strong>death</strong> being at the top of that list. The
picture given of the years before death and death itself is totally
misleading. A pretty image is painted of jolly old people with silver
hair, weaker in strength, but fit in mind and spirit. And then they,
presumably, need some hospitalization a few times and pass away
peacefully in bed. It always irked me that this was not what I
personally experienced with my grandparents, all of whom lived beyond
85-90 years. What I saw was totally different: a steady deterioration of
the mind and body, senile dementia combined with most embarrassing of
all: loss of bowel control. I witnessed how a person who was a rock in
your life can turn out to completely stress and depress their loved ones
in their last throes.</p>

<p>Though quite depressing to read, it is such experiences of her
parents’ last years that <strong>Roz Chast</strong> has captured in the
form of cartoons in her memoir <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1608198065/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1608198065&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=daariga-20&amp;linkId=QLOYJRDOS27TDFZ2"><strong>Can’t
We Talk About Something More Pleasant?</strong></a> She uses her
trademark humor to lighten the mood, but there is only so much you can
do when your parent is slowly losing all mental faculty. This is a great
book, coming especially from an Occidental author, where these travails
are hidden as much as possible.</p>
<p>We start off from the time her parents are living independently in
their Brooklyn flat, where they have lived all their life. To be honest
the first half of the book is quite cheery, filled with the oddities you
will notice about your parents once you turn into an adult. After
requiring a few hospitalizations, the first in their lives, it is
obvious that her parents are in their last years. Though losing their
memory, old people can be quite obstinate about changes and lots of
these situations stress out the author. As things worsen, they finally
agree to move out of their flat to a home for the aged. As health
further worsens, comes inability to move around, adult diapers, liquid
food and finally palliative care. In the end, the last words of a mind
that is switching off is ironically the first it ever uttered: calls to
a mother or a father.</p>
