<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 3/4 (A good modern reinvention of the legendary Sherlock Holmes.)</p>
<p>There have been countless attempts on the big and small screen to either faithfully recreate or creatively reinvent the legendary Sherlock Holmes. The new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_%28TV_series%29"><strong>Sherlock</strong></a> TV series on BBC tries to create a modern avatar of the detective. Benedict Cumberbatch plays an intelligent smart-ass Sherlock Holmes, while Martin Freeman plays a wise Dr. Watson. Season 1 features 3 movie-length (1.5 hour each) episodes.</p>
<p><strong>A Study in Pink</strong> is the opening episode, which as you may guess is inspired by the original <strong>A Study in Scarlet</strong>. In this case, Sherlock investigates a series of suicides, all of whom have died taking a pill. Dr. Watson returning from the war in Afghanistan becomes Sherlock’s flatmate at <strong>221B Baker Street</strong> and is drawn into the case to become Sherlock’s partner. In the climactic scene of the episode, Sherlock’s arch-nemesis Moriarty is introduced.</p>
<p>Sherlock’s second case <strong>The Blind Banker</strong> deals with a spray painted coded message at a bank and a banker who has killed himself. This case leads him to discover a smuggling ring that is communicating by using derelict Chinese symbols for communication. In the third and final case <strong>The Great Game</strong>, Sherlock is taunted and played around by his nemesis Moriarty. The latter sets up Sherlock on a chase to solve crime puzzles within a deadline, and threatens to kill citizens if he fails. The episode ends in a standoff between Sherlock and Moriarty.</p>
<p>Cumberbatch totally gets into the skin of a new Holmes, while Martin Freeman gives us a very comforting Dr. Watson. Put together, this pair is like fireworks. Each of the cases has been beautifully written. The pace and dialogues are a bit too fast for my taste. The cinematography is lovely, as is the smooth incorporation of modern technology into Sherlock’s repertoire. Each episode is the length of a movie and really does feel like a made-for-TV movie. The story telling is good and there is no way one can pull away once a case has gotten started. I loved A Study in Pink, the other two episodes were merely good. Sherlock is a good modern reinvention of Sherlock Holmes and I will be watching if more seasons are produced.</p>
