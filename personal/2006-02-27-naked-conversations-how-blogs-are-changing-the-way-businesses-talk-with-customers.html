<p>I wrapped up reading Naked Conversations : How Blogs are Changing the
Way Businesses Talk with Customers. The book is about business blogging.
It’s written by the popular blogger <a
href="http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/">Robert Scoble</a> and <a
href="http://seems2shel.typepad.com/">Shel Israel</a>. In the initial
chapters, the authors talk about how blogging at M$ and Sun have changed
the perception of the companies in the outside world. This has been true
in my case. I see a more human M$ after becoming a visitor to <a
href="http://channel9.msdn.com/">Channel 9</a>. Same at Sun, where
thousands of <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/">employees blog</a>,
including <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan">Jonathan Schwartz</a>.
Apple and Google come out bad in the book, both for not allowing
employees to blog about work.</p>
<p>In the later chapters, the book takes on different kinds of people
and businesses and discuss how and why blogging might help them. The
book is full of anecdotes and pointers to other blogs. Though the
anecdotes are interesting, there are too many of them and many are
similar, so it gets boring. The book might have carried the same message
in half its size.</p>
<p>The book has its <a href="http://redcouch.typepad.com/">own blog</a>
and also a <a
href="http://redcouch.typepad.com/weblog/2005/11/links_from_the_.html">list</a>
of the links referenced in the book.</p>
