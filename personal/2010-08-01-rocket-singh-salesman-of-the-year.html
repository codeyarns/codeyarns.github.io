<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 3/4 (Ranbir shines in an original Bollywood story by Shimit Amin)</p>
<p>Probably the biggest blunder committed by director Shimit Amin was to name his movie <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_Singh:_Salesman_of_the_Year"><strong>Rocket Singh: Salesman of the Year</strong></a>. Get past that dull name and you discover a shining new adventure starring Ranbir Kapoor. He plays Harpreet Singh Bedi, an average student who graduates and joins a computer sales firm as a trainee. He aspires to be a good salesman, but is disillusioned when he discovers the corruption and politics at his workplace. Discovering a niche for a genuinely customer centric sales company he launches Rocket Sales, right under the noses of his evil bosses. He gets into hot water when his undercover business is discovered and his boss readies to tear him down.</p>
<p>The story of Rocket Singh is completely original and stands out. The travails of an innocent graduate student in the harsh workplace are nicely captured with an eye for detail. Not just Ranbir Kapoor in his bearded-turbaned makeover, but his evil bosses Naveen Kaushik and Manish Chaudhary also bring some excellent acting to the table. Unusual for a Bollywood movie, there are no songs in this one, but the background score is not that great either. The cinematography is delicious, do not miss the colorful shots of Bedi's middle class home in the opening credits. After <strong><a href="http://moviemaathu.wordpress.com/2007/09/02/chak-de-india/">Chak De! India</a></strong>, Shimit Amin has created another delightful escapade in Rocket Singh, leaving me no choice now but to check out his debut movie <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ab_Tak_Chappan">Ab Tak Chappan</a></strong>.</p>
