<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 3/4 (Ranbir shines in an original Bollywood
story by Shimit Amin)</p>
<p>Probably the biggest blunder committed by director Shimit Amin was to
name his movie <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_Singh:_Salesman_of_the_Year"><strong>Rocket
Singh: Salesman of the Year</strong></a>. Get past that dull name and
you discover a shining new adventure starring Ranbir Kapoor. He plays
Harpreet Singh Bedi, an average student who graduates and joins a
computer sales firm as a trainee. He aspires to be a good salesman, but
is disillusioned when he discovers the corruption and politics at his
workplace. Discovering a niche for a genuinely customer centric sales
company he launches Rocket Sales, right under the noses of his evil
bosses. He gets into hot water when his undercover business is
discovered and his boss readies to tear him down.</p>
<p>The story of Rocket Singh is completely original and stands out. The
travails of an innocent graduate student in the harsh workplace are
nicely captured with an eye for detail. Not just Ranbir Kapoor in his
bearded-turbaned makeover, but his evil bosses Naveen Kaushik and Manish
Chaudhary also bring some excellent acting to the table. Unusual for a
Bollywood movie, there are no songs in this one, but the background
score is not that great either. The cinematography is delicious, do not
miss the colorful shots of Bedi’s middle class home in the opening
credits. After <strong><a href="2007-09-02-chak-de-india.html">Chak De!
India</a></strong>, Shimit Amin has created another delightful escapade
in Rocket Singh, leaving me no choice now but to check out his debut
movie <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ab_Tak_Chappan">Ab
Tak Chappan</a></strong>.</p>
