is <em>not</em> a book about the caste system of India. Rather it is an
innovative attempt by author <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabel_Wilkerson"><strong>Isabel
Wilkerson</strong></a> to demonstrate that the racism against Black
people in the US is yet another caste system. Caste is a rigid hierarchy
that people are born into and movement among the levels is absolutely
immutable. Isabel defines 8 pillars of caste, including the concepts of
divine will, purity, occupations, dehumanization, terror and
superiority. In addition to the Indian system which is referenced
extensively, she also uses the Nazi Germany as another comparison in her
examples. The various kinds of dehumanization and discrimination
practiced on Black people from the dawn of slavery in the Virginia
colony (1619), through the Civil War, Reconstruction era, Jim Crow, to
the current day are all covered in detail. To support her thesis, she
also shares many examples of injustice, barbarity and violence that have
been enacted on the Black people in the past 4 centuries.</p>
<p>Isabel is a great author, with a clear control over the language,
providing many quotable lines. She defined and described things that I
was already aware of from many new perspectives that made me think. She
demonstrated the right knowledge of the Indian caste system, the 4
varnas, the Dalits and of Ambedkar in the book. The dehumanized way in
which slaves were owned, punished and lynched was hard to stomach. Many
of these examples she describe go well beyond what we have already seen
in movies or in books. For example, mailing to relatives the gory photo
postcards of lynched Black men and women was a popular act in those
years. While I knew about the Civil War, I did not know how everything
regressed after the 12 years of Reconstruction and segregation was
enforced back across the nation.</p>
<p>How many Americans know that the Nazis took the US use of laws to
systematically discriminate as a guide to draft Nuremberg Blood Laws,
used for ethnic cleansing of Jews? Also surprising was how restrictive
the rights for Black people were right until the Voting Rights Act in
the 1960s. I felt that the latter parts of the book could have used some
real structure and maybe not every story had to be described. Caste is a
deep and powerful book that fits race into a new mould of caste and thus
enables us to look at it from a new perspective.</p>

<h2 id="excerpts">Excerpts</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The anthrax, like the reactivation of the human pathogens of hatred
and tribalism in this evolving century, had never died. It lay in wait,
sleeping, until extreme circumstances brought it to the surface and back
to life.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The election would set the United States on a course toward
isolationism, tribalism, the walling in and protecting of one’s own, the
worship of wealth and acquisition at the expense of others, even of the
planet itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Race is what we can see, the physical traits that have been given
arbitrary meaning and become shorthand for who a person is. Caste is the
powerful infrastructure that holds each group in its place.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus we are all born into a silent war-game, centuries old, enlisted
in teams not of our own choosing.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It was Du Bois who, decades before, had invoked an Indian concept in
channeling the bitter cry of his people in America: “Why did God make me
an outcast and a stranger in mine own house?”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Fromm found the working class to be among the most susceptible,
harboring an “inflated image of itself as the most admirable group in
the world, and of being superior to another racial group that is singled
out as inferior,” he wrote. A person in this group “feels: ‘even though
I am poor and uncultured I am somebody important because I belong to the
most admirable group in the world—I am white’; or ‘I am Aryan.’ ”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Bradley Effect—inflated polling numbers that do not materialize on
Election Day due to people telling pollsters what they believe is the
socially acceptable answer about their voting plans but then choosing
differently in the voting booth. This is what happened to Los Angeles
mayor Tom Bradley when he ran for governor of California in 1982.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“It’s all too easy to imagine that the Third Reich was a bizarre
aberration,” wrote the philosopher David Livingstone Smith, who has
studied cultures of dehumanization. “It’s tempting to imagine that the
Germans were (or are) a uniquely cruel and bloodthirsty people. But
these diagnoses are dangerously wrong. What’s most disturbing about the
Nazi phenomenon is not that the Nazis were madmen or monsters. It’s that
they were ordinary human beings.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Even the most privileged of humans in the Western world will join a
tragically disfavored caste if they live long enough. They will belong
to the last caste of the human cycle, that of old age, people who are
among the most demeaned of all citizens in the Western world, where
youth is worshipped to forestall thoughts of death. A caste system
spares no one.</p>
