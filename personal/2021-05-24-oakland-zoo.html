<h1 class="title">Oakland Zoo</h1>

<p>Though I do not like animals stuck in zoos, with a 5-year old in the
house visiting a zoo to see some of the wildlife becomes inevitable at
some point. Since COVID started, all places for kids have required
advanced ticket reservation and the weekend tickets are always sold out
months in advance. So when a free Friday presented itself, we booked
tickets to <a href="https://www.oaklandzoo.org/"><strong>Oakland
Zoo</strong></a>, pulled the kid out of school and drove there.</p>
<p>The zoo has 2 main sections: one at the ground level and another at
an elevation that can be reached by taking a gondola. The ground section
has a lot of rainforest primates (entertaining for the kids) and a few
rainforest birds. It also has the main attractions like tigers, lions,
elephants, giraffes and camels. (We just could not spot the tigers
though, either they were not there or their camouflage must be very
good.) There is also a small <strong>Children’s Zoo</strong> where we
could pet goats and sheep. All the kids, including our son, seemed to
love playing on the animal sculptures in the children’s playground here.
Many of the ground level exhibits had the <em>temporarily closed</em>
sign though, like that of the bugs which I was interested to see.</p>
<p>The <strong>gondola</strong> ride was pretty cool and took us to the
trail loop at the higher elevation called <strong>California
Trail</strong>. From far away, we can see bisons, condors, wolves,
grizzly bears and jaguars enclosed in larger sections here. The view
from the top of Oakland and San Francisco cities from here is also very
beautiful. There is a larger children’s playground here with a small
artifical stream where kids can soak their feet after all that walking.
This playground was probably the most popular spot at the zoo and our
kid spent an inordinate amount of time here while we relaxed.</p>
<p>We had food at <strong>The Landing Cafe</strong> at the upper gondola
station. Pizza from their wood fired oven and the fries both tasted
fresh and delicious.</p>
<p>We think the Oakland Zoo is a must visit if you have kids. We went
there at 11AM and our kid did not have a boring moment until the closing
time of 4PM. The playgrounds are especially popular and kids can play
there while parents can relax. Almost, 25% of the zoo was temporarily
closed and so we may need to visit again once it is fully open. Given
the price of the ticket ($24 for adult, $20 for child) this zoo is
simply great bang for buck.</p>
