<p>One of the gems that I discovered when I first started surfing the
Internet was <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Barry"><strong>Dave
Barry</strong></a>. Countless hours of my life have been spent reading
the archives of his hilarious Florida articles written for the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Herald"><strong>Miami
Herald</strong></a>. Considering the amount of pure happiness (and tummy
ache) his writing has given me, those were probably the most well-spent
hours of my life. When I recently discovered that he has many books to
his credit I had to get started on it!</p>
<p><strong>Dave Barry Talks Back</strong> is a collection of 63 old
articles, from before 1992. I was pleased to discover that I had not
previously read any of these. They sample all the zaniness on this
planet, ranging from relationships to family to pets to government to
politics. Since these were written for a newspaper with a strict word
limit, each of them is just 3 pages long. You can get shots of the
funnies all through the day by picking up this book!</p>
<p>Dave Barry is the real deal because the observations he makes about
us are genuine. Something else clearly stood out: the world of 1980s was
just as insane as our world today. The same ineptness and bungling by
government departments, the same weaselly politicians and most
importantly, the same crazy real-life events involving the common man
that keep happening around the world!</p>
<p>Except for a couple of dull pieces at the beginning and at the end,
it is hard to find fault in this collection. As an icing, each article
has a pertinent cartoon, drawn by <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_MacNelly"><strong>Jeff
MacNelly</strong></a>, another of my favorites. Much like <strong>Calvin
and Hobbes</strong> or <strong>Seinfeld</strong>, to me Dave Barry’s
writings are epic. Beware of where you read this book cause you will not
be able to control your snickering and giggling. This is a fantastic
mood lifter from probably the funniest writer in USA.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/4</p>

<p><strong>Excerpt:</strong></p>
<p>From the article <strong>Skivvying up the profits</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Recently — I bet this has happened to you — I ran out of clean
underwear in Los Angeles. So I wandered into the men’s clothing
department of an upscale department store, the kind of store where the
salesclerks all have sharp haircuts and perfectly tailored suits that
are far nicer than anything YOU own, and, although they act very
deferential, you know they’re secretly watching to see which clothes you
touch so they can have them burned later as a precaution against
vermin.</p>
So I was skulking around, looking for the underwear section, and I came
across the Ralph Lauren Exhibit, which, in addition to clothes, featured
an old saddle, croquet mallets, and various other props associated with
rich people. Ralph uses these to create a fashion look that has made him
several zillion dollars, a look that I would describe as “Wealthy
Constipated WASP.” His magazine advertisements feature Lauren-clad
people with their hair slicked back, standing around in large
antique-infested houses, looking grim, as if they have just received the
tragic news that one of their key polo ponies had injured itself
trampling a servant to death and would be unavailable for an important
match.
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>From the article <strong>Yellow Journalism</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
Dogs need to sniff the ground; it’s how they keep abreast of current
events. The ground is a giant dog newspaper, containing all kinds of
late-breaking dog news items, which, if they are especially urgent, are
often continued in the next yard. We live next to an
aircraft-carrier-sized dog named Bear, who is constantly committing acts
of prize-winning journalism around the neighborhood, and my dogs are
major fans of his work. Each morning, while I am shouting commands at
them, they race around and scrutinize the most recent installments of
the ongoing Bear oeuvre, vibrating their bodies ecstatically to
communicate their critical comments (“Bear has done it AGAIN!” “This is
CLASSIC Bear!” etc.).
