<p><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congo_(novel)"><strong>Congo</strong></a>
is a 1980 novel by <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Crichton"><strong>Michael
Crichton</strong></a> that takes us into the heart of Africa, pitting a
hunt for diamonds against an undiscovered species of primates. A
diamond-hunting expedition sent into Congo by the <em>Earth Resource
Technology Services (ERTS)</em> corporation is found dead at their camp
with their heads smashed in. <em>Karen Ross</em> is asked to create a
new team to figure out what happened out there and find these diamonds
that could be crucial to the semiconductory industry. A UC Berkeley
primatologist named <em>Peter Elliot</em> joins them along with his
gorilla <em>Amy</em> who he has trained in sign language communication.
To beat their Japanese-German rivals, they also enlist African field
expert <em>Charles Munro</em> who helps them build a team of porters and
guides them through the jungles, tribes and politics of Congo. Our
protagonists escape an ongoing war in Zaire, cannibals and carnivores to
reach the slopes of the volcano <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Mikeno">Mukenko</a>. They
realize that the location is actually the lost city of Zinj and
exploring the ruins discover an ancient civilization that thrived there
mining diamonds and training primates as guards. Night after night the
strange primates attack them, besting every smart defense they cook up.
Bit by bit, the team pieces together that these are a new species of
ferocious and smart gorilla that uses spoken and sign language and was
possibly created by cross-breeding by the Zinj people. Just as they
discover the diamond mines, Mukenko explodes burying Zinj for
eternity.</p>
<p>This book is classic Crichton, feeling very much like Jurassic Park,
but set in Africa. Much like that novel, it pits man and technology
against nature and evolution. Crichton gets into the details of Africa,
Congo, politics and war, the beasts and tribes of the jungles, primate
behavior making this a delightful read. Time and pages silently go by as
you bite your nails and are scared by truly great moments in the plot.
The mystery of the gorillas is slowly unraveled using a lot of
scientific analysis of their sounds, behavior and the ruins, thus making
the read intellectually stimulating. As is usual with Crichton,
everything is well researched (with lots of references), and takes the
reader on a dark, scary ride into the heart of the continent.</p>
<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 4/5</p>
