<p>A world controlled by nerds where AI and automation has eliminated
almost all jobs. Sounds scarily like the future of AI? This is actually
the setting of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_Piano_(novel)"><strong>Player
Piano</strong></a>, the 1952 debut novel by acclaimed author <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Vonnegut"><strong>Kurt
Vonnegut</strong></a>. Engineers and managers played a prominent role in
a 3rd Industrial Revolution and a 3rd World War and now they are in
charge. In cities like New York, the engineers and managers live in
high-tech mansions in a fenced Ilium Works conclave, while plebians live
in Homestead. People who are either not smart enough or interested to be
engineers can work in the Army or the <em>Reeks and Wrecks</em>
(Reconstruction and Reclamation Corps). The engineers think the normal
people, though mostly jobless, should be content since they have a basic
income that covers their health and all modern amenities. However, the
talented people who lost their jobs to machines are frustrated and a
Ghost Shirt Society pulls them together to foment a secret uprising
across the US.</p>
<p>We follow the life of our protagonist Dr. Paul Proteus, the leader of
Ilium as he navigates his career and relationship, and fantasizes
throwing it all away in pursuit of being free like his friend
<em>Finnerty</em>. Being the son of a world famous scientist, his career
is about to be boosted, if he toes the company line, as his too-perfect
wife <em>Anita</em> keeps reminding him. But Paul has been getting drawn
to the dirty and real life in Homestead and the talented-but-jobless
people out there. Things come to a head at the company retreat where
Paul is recruited to infiltrate the Ghost Shirts. However, to the shock
of his bosses and his wife, Paul actually sympathizes with the people
and they make him his leader and start an uprising against the
machines.</p>
<p>Vonnegut’s futuristic technology is severely dated - computers still
use vaccuum tubes, tape memory and punch cards and the women still don’t
have the top jobs. But damn, this man can write about people, society,
relationships and aspirations. It takes a while for the dark humor to
kick in and after that it becomes a joy ride. Everything has been
satirized: machines, automation, pointless jobs, office politics, career
growth in a corporation, boss-employee relationship, society’s classes.
The author puts both his serious characters and the incredibly funny
characters (like the visiting Shah and his Department of State guide)
through clever and dark surprises and twists. This is a rollercoaster
ride of a book, which both shines a light on serious social issues of
automation and AI, but also entertains in spades.</p>
<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 4/5</p>

<h2 id="excerpts">Excerpts</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“Gentlemen, things are ripe for a phony Messiah, and when he comes,
it’s sure to be a bloody business. Sooner or later someone’s going to
catch the imagination of these people with some new magic. At the bottom
of it will be a promise of regaining the feeling of participation, the
feeling of being needed on earth—hell, dignity. The police are bright
enough to look for people like that, and lock them up under the
antisabotage laws. But sooner or later someone’s going to keep out of
their sight long enough to organize a following.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There’s a nice Georgian house on Griffin Boulevard. Electronic door
openers, thermostatically controlled windows, radar range, electrostatic
dust precipitators, ultrasonic clothes washer built in, forty-inch
television screens in the master bedroom, guest room, living room,
kitchen, and rumpus rooms, and twenty-inch screens in the maids’ rooms
and the kiddies’ rooms.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“In order to get what we’ve got, we have, in effect, traded these
people out of what was the most important thing on earth to them—the
feeling of being needed and useful, the foundation of self-respect.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“The way they keep culture so cheap is by knowing in advance what and
how much of it people want. They get it right, right down to the color
of the jacket. Gutenberg would be amazed.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“You perhaps disagree with the antique and vain notion of Man’s being
a creation of God. But I find it a far more defensible belief than the
one implicit in intemperate faith in lawless technological
progress—namely, that man is on earth to create more durable and
efficient images of himself, and, hence, to eliminate any justification
at all for his own continued existence.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“If only it weren’t for the people, the goddamned people, always
getting tangled up in the machinery. If it weren’t for them, earth would
be an engineer’s paradise.”</p>
</blockquote>
