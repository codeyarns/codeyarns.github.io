<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 2/4 (Akash is a ho-hum poor-guy-meets-rich-gal movie that can be avoided.)</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puneet_Rajkumar">Puneeth Rajkumar</a></strong> is the most successful actor in the Kannada movie industry right now. <strong>Akash</strong> (<strong>ಆಕಾಶ್</strong>) is one of his early movies, released in 2005. I got interested to watch it after I came away pretty impressed by his recent movie <a href="http://moviemaathu.wordpress.com/2010/09/05/milana/"><strong>Milana</strong></a> with Parvathi Menon.</p>
<p>Akash, as it turns out, is the typical poor-guy and rich-gal love story. Every actor in India seems to have a few of these dull movies in their filmography! Akash, the protagonist is a good Samaritan and Ramya, the rich-gal has a pair of villainous brothers. Throw in some situation comedy, a few songs and a fight every half hour and you have the movie. Puneeth's acting is amateurish and his voice is grating. The music is pretty insipid, save for the one song which I like: <strong>Neene Neene</strong>. Directed by Mahesh Babu, Akash is a movie that can be avoided.</p>
