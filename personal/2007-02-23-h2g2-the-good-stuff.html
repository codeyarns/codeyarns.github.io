<p><a href="http://karthik-1979.livejournal.com/15327.html">blogged</a> his favorite lines from <a href="http://yodha.livejournal.com/243279.html">H2G2</a>, I thought I should pick some of mine too. I'm skipping the oft heard ones like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Answer_to_Life%2C_the_Universe%2C_and_Everything">42</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_Panic_%28Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy%29">Don't Panic</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mostly_Harmless">Mostly Harmless</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/So_Long,_and_Thanks_for_All_the_Fish">So Long, And Thanks For All The Fish</a>. The list can go on forever, so I'm restricting myself to 3:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>When the Drink button was pressed it made an instant but highly detailed examination of the subject's taste buds, a spectroscopic analysis of the subject's metabolism and then sent tiny experimental signals down the neural pathways to the taste centres of the subject's brain to see what was likely to go down well. However, no one knew quite why it did this because it invariably delivered a cupful of liquid that was almost, but not quite, entirely unlike tea.</em> — I doubt anyone can write delicate titillating prose like this anymore. I distinctly remember the first time I came across it in a beautiful article that appeared in <em><a href="http://www.pcworld.in/">PC World India</a></em>. This was way way back, before I'd even heard of H2G2.</p></li>
<li><p><em>He felt that his whole life was some kind of dream and he sometimes wondered whose it was and whether they were enjoying it.</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>The History of every major Galactic Civilization tends to pass through three distinct and recognizable phases, those of Survival, Inquiry and Sophistication, otherwise known as the How, Why and Where phases. For instance, the first phase is characterized by the question &quot;How can we eat?&quot; the second by the question &quot;Why do we eat?&quot; and the third by the question &quot;Where shall we have lunch?&quot;</em></p></li>
</ul>
