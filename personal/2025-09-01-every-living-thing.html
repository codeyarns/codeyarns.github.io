<p><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Every_Living_Thing_(Roberts_book)"><strong>Every
Living Thing</strong></a> is a popular science book about the 18th
century race to classify and name all natural life and the rivalry
between naturalists Buffon and Linnaeus.</p>
<p>From Sweden, we have the pompous <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Linnaeus"><strong>Linnaeus</strong></a>
who published the <em>Systema Naturae (The System of Nature)</em> in
1735. He created a 5-level hierarchy to classify all known plants and
animals divided into kingdoms, classes, orders, families and species. He
would spend the rest of his life refining this classification system and
classifying all the new species that were being discovered around the
world. In hindsight, his most controversial move would be to divide
humans into 4 races to which he attached stereotypical
characteristics.</p>
<p>In France of the same era, we have eminent naturalist <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges-Louis_Leclerc,_Comte_de_Buffon"><strong>Buffon</strong></a>
who started publishing volumes of his epic <em>Histoire Naturelle</em>
in 1749. By the time of his death, this included a massive 36 volumes
and would set him as the most prominent naturalist of that century. He
was not only the first naturalist to write about hundreds of species in
exquisite illustrated detail, but he also questioned the Linnaean
taxonomy, racial categorization of humans, slavery, virginity,
evolution, extinction and the Genesis.</p>
<p>These two naturalists would fight a battle of thoughts through most
of this century while pushing the boundaries of natural discovery and
the creation of whole new areas of science. The book also goes into the
French revolution and the rise in popularity of Linnaeus after that. It
also put into perspective Darwin, Huxley, Mendel and the arrival of
evolution at the gates of science.</p>
<p>This book by <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Roberts_(author)"><strong>Jason
Roberts</strong></a> is thoroughly referenced and detailed and is in a
similar vein to <a href="2020-08-04-the-invention-of-nature.html">The
Discovery of Nature</a> which is about Humboldt. I loved that it helped
place all of these happenings in natural history in the right historical
context. I also learnt a ton of etymology behind the common words in
science and their historical origins. Buffon’s work and life is
unbelievably massive and it is not surprising that he is considered
France’s most eminent man of science. The book has a lot of the
illustrations of the men and the creatures of that era, but I felt that
it could have used more. The biggest problem is that, yet again, we have
an author who knows too much and forces us to read about every single
acquaintance, correspondence and happening of their lives. This book
could have been condensed down from its 400 pages down to 300 easily and
would have been a fantastic recommendation.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 3/5</p>
<h2 id="excerpts">Excerpts</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Buffon famously read drafts aloud to friends, asked them to
paraphrase what they heard, then rewrote anything muddled or
misunderstood, a process he repeated up to seventeen times for a single
chapter. “Good writing is good thinking, good awareness, and good
execution, all at once” was his dictum.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To say that Histoire Naturelle was a bestseller is an understatement.
Hailed as both a landmark of science and a work of literature, it was a
publishing phenomenon that made Buffon the most popular nonfiction
author in French history. Each new volume’s release sparked a flurry of
sales and a round of public debate.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The family had no name. This was common in rural Sweden, where
surnames were rarely necessary; one’s lifelong presence on ancestral
land served as identity enough. Most males, when required to provide
one, adopted the simple patronymic of adding -son to their father’s
given name, a practice that would eventually populate Sweden with a
healthy percentage of Johannsons, Petersons, and Svensons. But in the
fall of 1690, a sixteen-year-old named Nils made a different choice.
Instead of becoming Nils Ingemarsson, he decided to commemorate his
family’s tree by adopting the surname Linnaeus. It meant “man of the
linden tree,” not in Swedish but in Latin.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Many professional scholars adopted Latin versions of their surnames,
which is why Michel de Nostredame is better known as Nostradamus, and
why Nikolaj Kopernik is remembered as Nicolaus Copernicus.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Aside from a few items such as tincture of opium, drugs in the modern
sense of the term did not exist. In their place was an arsenal of
salves, poultices, elixirs, and other concoctions collectively known as
physicks, a term that gave rise to calling the doctors who applied them
“physicians.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the books he’d read during his Dijon self-exile was Analysis
of the Infinitely Small, an early French treatise on the new mathematics
of calculus. It was his first encounter with Sir Isaac Newton.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In the Europe of 1731, higher education remained rooted in the
practical. The professor of mathematics, for instance, taught the
subject of geometry through the task of building fortresses, then
through an analysis of artillery trajectories needed to destroy them.
Learning not only had purpose at its core, it was also demarcated
differently. Today we make distinctions between sciences and humanities,
but in Buffon’s time the great division was between history and
philosophy. Both words had very different meanings than they have today.
In the modern sense, history means “things that happened in the past,”
while philosophy means “concepts and ideas relevant to existence.” At
the time, history meant all that was tangible, occurring in observable
reality—things as well as events. Conversely, philosophy concerned
itself with the intangible—ideas and principles, which might manifest
themselves in the physical world but exist on their own as abstractions.
History and philosophy were in turn bisected by a single criterion:
whether or not they pertained to humans. The word natural was applied to
all non-human phenomena. This reflected an important divide in the
perceived nature of knowledge. Botany and zoology, both studies of
living things, came under the rubric of “natural history,” a label that
also encompassed astronomy (the sky above) and mineralogy (the earth
below). Yet theorizing—seeking to understand why life manifested and
behaved as it did—belonged to the entirely different discipline of
“natural philosophy,” where it kept company with mathematics and what we
know today as physics. Natural historians surveyed and catalogued,
leaving principles to be discerned by natural philosophers. The
quantitative and the qualitative were separate realms.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What happens when you can’t count all possible outcomes? Buffon
invited his audience to imagine a needle tossed onto a square-tiled
floor. What are the odds of it landing so that it intersects a tile’s
edge? Calculating all the permutations, every single possible site and
angle of a dropped needle, becomes a task that quickly approaches
infinity. Does that mean the odds are unknowable? Not at all, Buffon
asserted. Take an entire box of needles and dump them on the floor, he
directed, so that they scatter in a single layer. Count the number of
needles crossing a tile, then gather them up. Toss and count them again.
Repeat a dozen times, or a hundred. Average up the results of each toss
and count, and you begin to arrive at an approximation. The full power
of Buffon’s insight, however, became clear when he pointed out the
process could be reversed. Want to count all the needles in a very large
box? Instead of laboriously tallying them all, it’s a much quicker
matter to scatter them all on the tiles, then count only the
intersecting ones.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Our current popular understanding [of the word species] is that it
means a particular kind of lifeform that exists as a distinct
population, one capable of propagating itself over time. To Linnaeus’s
generation, the concept was far more fluid. The word is simply Latin for
“appearance.” When a botanist used the term species in 1729, it was a
shorthand for “plants that have this appearance.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We take as a given that each species has a representative population,
and that this population is subject to change. If meaningful differences
arise in the population [of a species] over a long span of generations
we call that process evolution. If evolution produces profound enough
changes, we declare that population a new and different species. If a
population no longer maintains itself, we say the species ends. This
process we call extinction.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Genesis, the first book of the Bible, establishes a strict sequence
for the arrival of life. It attests that after spending the initial day
separating darkness from light, God devoted the second day to raising up
dry land, naming it Earth, and willing into existence the very first
lifeforms: “plants yielding seed, and fruit trees of every kind on earth
that bear fruit with the seed in it.” Summoning “two great lights” (the
sun and moon), adding stars, and fixing them in the appropriate places
occupied the third day. On the fourth day, to populate the newly wrought
sea and sky, “God created the great sea monsters and every living
creature that moves, of every kind, with which the waters swarm, and
every winged bird of every kind.” Land-based creatures were the sixth
day’s agenda, “the wild animals of the earth of every kind, and the
cattle of every kind, and everything that creeps upon the ground of
every kind.” Later that day, the Lord capped off His work by creating
humans, then bidding them to “fill the earth and subdue it; and have
dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the air and over
every living thing that moves upon the earth.” Plants and trees on the
second day. Birds, fish, and sea monsters on the fourth. All other
organisms on the sixth. By the dawn of the seventh day, Creation was
complete. Thereafter the tableau of existence was static.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In Systema Naturae, Linnaeus divided his subject into 3
<em>kingdoms</em>. “Minerals grow; Plants grow and live; Animals grow,
live and have feeling,” he wrote. He broke animals into
<em>classes</em>—fish, birds, amphibians, insects. Drilling down
further, he made divisions based on a prominent physical
characteristic—the size and shape of birds’ beaks, for instance—which he
called <em>orders</em>. He further clustered these into groupings based
on physical similarities, which he termed genera (plural of
<em>genus</em>, a Latin word meaning “family” or “type”). Finally he
arrived at the specific: the category he labeled <em>species</em>,
meaning that which could be represented by a single individual organism.
Kingdoms, classes, orders, genus, species. Linnaeus firmly believed that
these five nested boxes sufficed to contain all animal life.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>On the fifth and final hierarchy—the level of species—Linnaeus
applied only single-word names. For humans, Linnaeus did not choose the
Latin word Humanus but instead Homo, a word the Romans had cribbed from
the Greeks, literally meaning “of the same” but understood in Latin as
“man.” Of the 549 species described in the first edition of Systema
Naturae, Linnaeus knew Homo was the most controversial listing of all.
It was treading in dangerous waters to place humans in the animal
kingdom, much less in the same genus as sloths and baboons.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The 78-page 2nd edition included anteaters alongside the sloths,
monkeys, apes, and humans in the order Anthropomorpha. Far more
significantly, the description of the species Homo now included the
phrase homo variat: Man varies. What followed were four fateful entries:
Europaeus albus (White European), Americanus rubescens (Red American),
Asiaticus fuscus (Tawny Asian), and Africanus niger (Black African).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In september of 1749, the first three volumes of Buffon’s Histoire
Naturelle arrived at booksellers throughout France. The volumes were
hefty (417,600 words long, spread across 1,600 cumulative pages),
handsomely bound and printed, and bearing the pedigree of the king’s own
Imprimerie Royale. Yet despite their length and detail, they examined
only a single animal (horse). After an opening salvo on systemists in
general and Linnaeus in particular, Buffon spent most of the first
volume and all of the second putting forth his theories of the Earth’s
formation and development It was not until the third volume that he took
up the subject of what Linnaeus had labeled class Quadrupedia, order
Anthropomorphia, species Homo.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It was an act of what he confessed as “pérsiflage,” a flattering but
patently insincere flutter of words. The incident inspired one of
Buffon’s more famous quips: “It is better to be humble than be
hung.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As to the names themselves, Linnaeus established a new structure.
Each would henceforth contain two parts: a generic name, identifying the
genus, and a specific name unique to the species. To strictly enforce
hierarchy as identity, to sweep away all linguistic flourishes in favor
of a simple two-part label—that was an innovation that set natural
history on the steel rails of standardization.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Adanson unveiled his system of reforming taxonomical names. It
operated on 3 principles, which he dubbed the “rules of appointment.”
Rule 1: Use the historically oldest name for a species you can find.
Rule 2: Name a genus after its most common or best-known species. Rule
3: Standardize spellings and pronunciation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To Buffon, the essence of species lay in reproduction, the ability of
one generation to propagate another. He logically applied this measure
to humanity: Since all ethnic groups seemed clearly capable of
interbreeding with one another, they comprised a single species. “The
dissimilarities are merely external, the alterations of nature but
superficial,” he concluded. “The Asian, European, and Negro all
reproduce with equal ease with the American. There can be no greater
proof that they are the issue of a single and identical stock than the
facility with which they consolidate to the common stock.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Asserting extinction as fact was controversy enough—again, orthodoxy
held that the death of an entire species would imply a flaw, an error,
in God’s perfect creation. But Buffon pressed on, insulating what he
knew to be dangerous ideas by making them islands of text in a sea of
general observations about ospreys and otters. As he put it in a private
letter to a friend, “One can slip ideas into a quarto volume which would
cause a public outcry if they appeared in a pamphlet.”</p>
