href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora_(novel)"><strong>Aurora</strong></a>
is the interstellar journey of a <em>generation ship</em> in the hopes
of resettling on a moon of that name in the Tau Ceti system. This
massive ship is designed as two massive rotating rings holding the
different biomes from Earth. <strong>Devi</strong>, the main ship
engineer is informally the leader, and she lives her entire life
worrying over the innumerable problems on the ship that throws the
delicate life cycle off-balance. The ship reaches Aurora and discovers a
desolate land of extreme winds and water. Some of the humans land and
start to explore, find a habitable place and start building the
infrastructure necessary for permanent resettlement. Their hopes are
dashed when mysterious <em>prions</em> start killing the visitors and
they are not able to find a defense. There is a violent civil war on the
ship between <em>Stayers</em> (who want to try living on a nearby moon
<em>Iris</em>) and <em>Backers</em> (who want to return to Earth and
supporters of Devi’s daughter <strong>Freya</strong>). The ship’s AI
finally steps in to take control and the Backers end up helping the
Stayers reach Iris and then begin their journey back to Earth. The ship
has been falling apart since the demise of Devi and they only make it
back thanks to the awakened AI and transmissions from Earth on the
science of <em>cryo sleep</em>. When we finally reach the solar system,
slowing down becomes an incredibly hard problem and the AI performs some
amazing stunts to finally make it.</p>
<p>This is a hard sci-fi book of massive vision and scale by <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Stanley_Robinson"><strong>Kim
Stanley Robinson</strong></a>. The long journey to Aurora and resettling
there reminded me <a href="2023-11-27-children-of-time.html">The
Children of Time</a>. The details of the ship structure, functioning and
life aboard it reminded me of <a
href="2020-09-28-rendezvous-with-rama.html">Rendezvous with Rama</a>.
What makes this book unique though are the real scientific, biological
and social challenges of such space travel and settling and the humans
deciding to return back to Earth. A lot of these problems are what <a
href="2024-05-10-a-city-on-mars.html">A City on Mars</a> cautions us
about. There are a couple of great twists, when we discover that the
narrator was the ship’s AI all along, and when we discover that there
had been a 2nd sister ship on this journey. What I found unsatisfying
was how easily they gave up on the prions problem, the non-existence of
a leadership structure on the ship and many long sections that could
have been skipped. I still enjoyed the journey of this book, am amazed
by Kim’s thinking and would be reading more of his books.</p>

<h2 id="excerpts">Excerpts</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Anytime people do something consciously for the last time, Samuel
Johnson is reported to have remarked, they feel sad.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Early dreams of terraforming Mars quickly, and thus having a second
Earth to walk around on, had come to grief, mainly because of four
physical factors overlooked in the first flush of optimistic plans: the
surface of Mars was almost entirely covered by perchlorate salts, a form
of chlorine salts that had given Devi fits as well, as only a few parts
per billion gave humans terrible thyroid problems, and could not be
endured. Worse yet, there turned out to be only a few parts per million
of nitrates in the Martian soil and regolith, an odd feature of its
original low elemental endowment of nitrogen, the reason for which was
still a source of debate, but meanwhile, no nitrates, and thus no
nitrogen available for the creation of an atmosphere. And so the
terraforming plans were faced with a radical insufficiency. Then third,
it was becoming clear that the fines on the Martian surface, having been
milled by billions of years of drifting in the winds, were so much finer
than dust particles on Earth that it was extremely difficult to keep
them out of stations, machines, and human lungs; and they wreaked damage
on all three. And last, the lack of a strong magnetic field meant that a
thick atmosphere was really needed to intercept radiation from space,
before the surface would be very safe for humans to be on.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“No starship voyage will work. This is an idea some of you have,
which ignores the biological realities of the situation. We from Tau
Ceti know this better than anyone. There are ecological, biological,
sociological, and psychological problems that can never be solved to
make this idea work. The physical problems of propulsion have captured
your fancy, and perhaps these problems can be solved, but they are the
easy ones. The biological problems cannot be solved. And no matter how
much you want to ignore them, they will exist for the people you send
out inside these vehicles. The bottom line is the biomes you can propel
at the speeds needed to cross such great distances are too small to hold
viable ecologies. The distances between here and any truly habitable
planets are too great. And the differences between other planets and
Earth are too great. Other planets are either alive or dead. Living
planets are alive with their own indigenous life, and dead planets can’t
be terraformed quickly enough for the colonizing population to survive
the time in enclosure. Only a true Earth twin not yet occupied by life
would allow this plan to work, and these may exist somewhere, the galaxy
after all is big, but they are too far away from us. Viable planets, if
they exist, are simply too—far—away.”</p>
