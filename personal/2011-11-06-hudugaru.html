<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudugaru">ಹುಡುಗರು</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudugaru">Hudugaru</a>) is a Kannada masala movie starring Puneeth Rajkumar, released earlier in 2011. Directed by <strong>K. Madesh</strong>, it is a remake of the Tamil movie <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naadodigal"><strong>Naadodigal</strong></a>. Puneeth, Srinagara Kitty and Yogesh play three close friends leaving carefree but disillusioned lives in the town of Shravanabelagola. Just when their luck seems to turn for the better, Puneeth's friend shows up at his doorstep asking for his help to elope with his girlfriend. The task is not easy since the lovers are the progeny of a rich industrialist and that of a powerful politician. Putting their lives at risk, the trio kidnap the girlfriend and help the couple to get married in secrecy. In the process, Puneeth loses his grandmother, Kitty his leg and Yogesh his hearing. They are enraged when they learn that their efforts were wasted since the couple decide to separate over marital differences.</p>
<p>Though it seems like a violent movie, there is little of that in Hudugaru. The movie is an unnecessarily long 2.5 hours, though it is thankfully bearable. It is helped by good comedy by all the characters, especially Yogesh. Radhika Pandit and a whole host of actors are introduced, but are completely wasted in their roles. The movie could have been a lot shorter by cutting out these characters and a lot of the petty banter. Shot all over small-town Karnataka, the production quality is nice.  The songs are passable, the one that I like is <strong>Neeralli Sanna Ale</strong>, whose lilting lyrics are penned (unsurprisingly) by Jayant Kaikini. Hudugaru is an entertaining movie that can be watched once.</p>
