<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Teeth"><strong>Dragon
Teeth</strong></a> is one of those posthumously published novels of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Crichton"><strong>Michael
Crichton</strong></a>. Set in 1875, this story thrusts Yale University
student William Johnson into the rivalry between paleontologists Marsh
and Cope. Johnson signs on to Marsh’s expedition for dinosaur bones and
starts off on a long railroad journey from Philadelphia to the American
West (Wyoming, Idaho and Montana). He soon learns that Marsh is an evil
smooth-talking cut-throat and ends up joining Cope’s expedition. Cope
and his ragtag bunch of explorers are thrust into the midst of a war
between the US Army and Native American tribes. They venture far into
Native American territory on horseback and discover amazing new kinds of
dinosaurs, even when thwarted by Marsh’s henchmen. On the return,
Johnson is separated with the precious boxes of bones and he endures a
year long story of survival in dangerous Wild West towns filled with
insane trigger-happy shooters.</p>
<p>Apparently the story is based on a real rivalry between the
professors of that era. It is an easy read, with the emphasis being on
surviving in the great outdoors and life in Wild West towns and very
little about the bones. The plot itself is a bit of a stretch, relying
on innumerable contrivances to enable Johnson to survive and hold on to
the bones. Similar to <a
href="2024-10-05-pirate-latitudes.html"><strong>Pirate
Latitudes</strong></a>, it is clear why a perfectionist like Crichton
did not end up publishing this during his lifetime. Though it is
entertaining, it does not have the depth or polish of his famous
works.</p>
<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 3/5</p>
