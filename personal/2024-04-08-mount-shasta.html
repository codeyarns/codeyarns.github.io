<p>We spent a few days of our kid’s school spring break exploring the
region near <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Shasta"><strong>Mount
Shasta</strong></a>.</p>
<h2 id="getting-there-and-back">Getting there and back</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Driving to and from Fremont to Mount Shasta city was easy. It is
about 4-5 hours away and the route through I-5 and I-505 is a 2-lane
freeway that is relatively free of traffic and jerks.</p></li>
<li><p>The only reasonable stops along this route are at Vacaville and
Redding. Both these cities have Walmart Supercenters, general
restaurants and Redding also has a Costco. We used these cities to stop
for lunch and refuel.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mount-shasta-city">Mount Shasta city</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Shasta,_California"><strong>Mount
Shasta</strong></a> is also a sleepy little city over which the
snow-covered majestic Mount Shasta looms over. We stayed at a cabin just
outside the city and it was just a 5 minute drive into the city for food
and groceries.</p></li>
<li><p>The Shasta City Supermarket is a friendly place to grab
groceries. The ACE Hardware in the city has pretty much everything, we
got our sled there.</p></li>
<li><p>Andaman is a cozy little Thai restaurant with friendly staff and
spicy food.</p></li>
<li><p>The <a
href="https://www.siskiyoulandtrust.org/projects-2/sisson-meadow/"><strong>Sission
Meadow</strong></a> in the city is a great place to take an evening walk
under fantastic views of Mount Shasta in the background.</p></li>
<li><p>We could not try tubing for our kids at the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Shasta_Ski_Park"><strong>Mount
Shasta Ski Park</strong></a> since that had closed for the season.
Instead, we did sledding on the <strong>Snowman’s Sledding Hill</strong>
and it was lots of fun.</p></li>
<li><p>The nearby <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Siskiyou"><strong>Lake
Siskiyou</strong></a> has fantastic views of the surrounding landscapes
from its expansive beach. However, the road to get there was terribly
unpaved and could destroy your car until it is fixed.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="shasta-dam">Shasta Dam</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>An hour from Mt Shasta city and near Redding is the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shasta_Dam"><strong>Shasta Dam
Visitor Center</strong></a>. Both the kids and us found this to be a
highly educational and fun place to experience.</p></li>
<li><p>This is the 2nd biggest dam in the US. Plan to arrive here 20
minutes before their guided tour of the dam (9AM, 11AM and 2PM). Watch
an engrossing 20-minute documentary about the dam before heading out
with your guide.</p></li>
<li><p>Our guide Linda was an Army veteran and was super friendly in
taking us over the dam and explaining all the features. Both adults and
kids alike were able to actually learn how a dam is constructed,
operated and how the water is used to generate electricity here. A visit
to the turbine center was not possible since the elevators were under
repair.</p></li>
<li><p>The visitor center also has clean toilets, indoor play area for
kids and tons of parking outside.</p></li>
<li><p>NOTE: Plan to visit Mon-Fri, since they are closed
Sat-Sun.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sundial-bridge">Sundial bridge</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundial_Bridge_at_Turtle_Bay"><strong>Sundial
Bridge</strong></a> is a popular local tourist spot in Redding. This
turned out to be a great place to visit during the evening and walk over
the Sacramento bridge and take pics. Lots of people and kids relaxing
and having fun here. Parking can get tight though.</p></li>
<li><p>Redding Garden of Lights is at the other end of the bridge. The
light structures at this garden are lit up at night. But we visited
during the afternoon and it was still fun. There are an endless number
of animal light structures bringing joy to kids here.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Besides these places, there is also Burney Falls (which we visited on
the way back) and <a
href="2020-10-10-lassen-volcanic-national-park.html">Lassen Volcanic
National Park</a> nearby. All these places make this region of NorCal a
great place to visit with less of the tourist crowd compared to other
places in California.</p>
