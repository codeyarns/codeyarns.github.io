<p>We spent a few days of our kid’s school spring break exploring the region near <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Shasta"><strong>Mount Shasta</strong></a>.</p>
<h2 id="getting-there-and-back">Getting there and back</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Driving to and from Fremont to Mount Shasta city was easy. It is about 4-5 hours away and the route through I-5 and I-505 is a 2-lane freeway that is relatively free of traffic and jerks.</p></li>
<li><p>The only reasonable stops along this route are at Vacaville and Redding. Both these cities have Walmart Supercenters, general restaurants and Redding also has a Costco. We used these cities to stop for lunch and refuel.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mount-shasta-city">Mount Shasta city</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Shasta,_California"><strong>Mount Shasta</strong></a> is also a sleepy little city over which the snow-covered majestic Mount Shasta looms over. We stayed at a cabin just outside the city and it was just a 5 minute drive into the city for food and groceries.</p></li>
<li><p>The Shasta City Supermarket is a friendly place to grab groceries. The ACE Hardware in the city has pretty much everything, we got our sled there.</p></li>
<li><p>Andaman is a cozy little Thai restaurant with friendly staff and spicy food.</p></li>
<li><p>The <a href="https://www.siskiyoulandtrust.org/projects-2/sisson-meadow/"><strong>Sission Meadow</strong></a> in the city is a great place to take an evening walk under fantastic views of Mount Shasta in the background.</p></li>
<li><p>We could not try tubing for our kids at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Shasta_Ski_Park"><strong>Mount Shasta Ski Park</strong></a> since that had closed for the season. Instead, we did sledding on the <strong>Snowman’s Sledding Hill</strong> and it was lots of fun.</p></li>
<li><p>The nearby <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Siskiyou"><strong>Lake Siskiyou</strong></a> has fantastic views of the surrounding landscapes from its expansive beach. However, the road to get there was terribly unpaved and could destroy your car until it is fixed.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="shasta-dam">Shasta Dam</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>An hour from Mt Shasta city and near Redding is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shasta_Dam"><strong>Shasta Dam Visitor Center</strong></a>. Both the kids and us found this to be a highly educational and fun place to experience.</p></li>
<li><p>This is the 2nd biggest dam in the US. Plan to arrive here 20 minutes before their guided tour of the dam (9AM, 11AM and 2PM). Watch an engrossing 20-minute documentary about the dam before heading out with your guide.</p></li>
<li><p>Our guide Linda was an Army veteran and was super friendly in taking us over the dam and explaining all the features. Both adults and kids alike were able to actually learn how a dam is constructed, operated and how the water is used to generate electricity here. A visit to the turbine center was not possible since the elevators were under repair.</p></li>
<li><p>The visitor center also has clean toilets, indoor play area for kids and tons of parking outside.</p></li>
<li><p>NOTE: Plan to visit Mon-Fri, since they are closed Sat-Sun.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sundial-bridge">Sundial bridge</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundial_Bridge_at_Turtle_Bay"><strong>Sundial Bridge</strong></a> is a popular local tourist spot in Redding. This turned out to be a great place to visit during the evening and walk over the Sacramento bridge and take pics. Lots of people and kids relaxing and having fun here. Parking can get tight though.</p></li>
<li><p>Redding Garden of Lights is at the other end of the bridge. The light structures at this garden are lit up at night. But we visited during the afternoon and it was still fun. There are an endless number of animal light structures bringing joy to kids here.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Besides these places, there is also Burney Falls (which we visited on the way back) and <a href="2020-10-10-lassen-volcanic-national-park.html">Lassen Volcanic National Park</a> nearby. All these places make this region of NorCal a great place to visit with less of the tourist crowd compared to other places in California.</p>
