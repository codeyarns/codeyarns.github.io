<p>I must thank VC and P for bringing up George Orwell’s <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Farm">Animal Farm</a> so many
times that I ended up reading it this weekend. This is the first Orwell
work I have read, no not read 1984 yet.</p>
<p>The novella is about animals on a farm that free themselves from
their human masters. At first they work hard, have equality and are
happy. Soon, different classes form (pigs, dogs, the rest) and the farm
takes on a communist flavour. From here on, Orwell takes the reader on a
complete transition of the farm from freedom to communism to
communist-dictatorship. Since Orwell is using animals (instead of
humans) he can create classes and gets away with some brilliant
analogies. The book is tiny and takes only a few hours. Must read.</p>
<p>The book leaves a lot of questions hanging. It shows how even in an
ideal communist flavour of an equal society, greed and power will slowly
work their way and turn it into hell. But, what kind of
society/governance was that of Mr. Jones (their human owner)?
Monarchy/dictatorship? Communism certainly didn’t work on the farm, but
was there really a better solution where one class wouldn’t screw the
rest? I don’t expect Orwell to answer this, but the question is
inevitable. Also scary is the fact that the techniques the pigs use on
the animals can be seen at work in both the most famous and the most
popular democracies of the world today. I don’t mean to say that these
are becoming communist, but rather that the public no longer know what’s
really happening with them.</p>
