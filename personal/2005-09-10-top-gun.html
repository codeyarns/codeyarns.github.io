<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/4 (Thrilling aerial dogfights, great music and Kelly McGillis. Need I say more?)</p>
<p>I thought that it had been some time since I last saw it, so caught up with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_Gun_%28film%29">Top Gun</a> again. This is a movie I could watch many more times. Young Tom Cruise looking his smashing best, beautiful Kelly McGillis and fighter planes: a heady mix! :-)</p>
<p>Maverick (Tom Cruise) and Iceman (Val Kilmer) are competitors at <em>Top Gun</em>, the top fighter pilot school in the USA. Kelly is the civilian instructor at the school whom Maverick falls in love with (she actually looks way older than Tom Cruise in the movie). Maverick stays true to his name in flight and fight, dangering all those around him. His navigator Goose dies in a plane engine failure that Maverick blames on himself. But when enemies attack and duty calls, Iceman and Maverick deliver the goods with a neat plane combat. The background music in the movie is excellent. Filled with thrilling fighter plane dogfights, I love this movie!</p>
