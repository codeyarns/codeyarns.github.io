<p>Childhood is a time when we try to adapt to the world around us and
it is a place from where we draw most of our memories. <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kid_with_a_Bike"><strong>Le
Gamin au vélo</strong></a> (<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kid_with_a_Bike"><strong>The Kid
with a Bike</strong></a>) follows the childhood of a boy for a few days
as he tries to navigate and live with the world he is cast in. When the
movie begins, Cyril is at a foster home where his single dad left him
due to financial problems. Cyril is a bright kid and tries to track down
where his father has disappeared to. His search brings him across
Samantha, a woman who helps get his old bicycle back. She allows him to
stay at her home during weekends, while he continues his search. When he
finally finds his dad, his heart breaks when his dad asks him to never
see him again since he wants to move on with life. Distraught Cyril
falls prey to the local teenage gangster, who uses him to get one of his
jobs done. The repercussions of his con job end up affecting him and his
relationship with Samantha.</p>
<p>Set in summery Belgium, Le Gamin au vélo is a light and breezy
experience. Reminding me very much of my carefree summer holidays of
childhood, the cinematography feels very natural and personal. Many
facets of the human experience emerge through the prism of Cyril’s
adventures: search for a father figure, discovering good and bad,
learning that actions have reactions, and finally a woman discovering
that she likes to have a son. All of this comes through without any of
the affectations that are typical baggage in a Hollywood movie.</p>
<p><strong>Thomas Doret</strong>, who plays Cyril, is a gem of a find.
He brings across the precociousness of his character with a performance
that feels very real and devoid of mannerisms. How the directors managed
to extract such a raw performance out of him, I cannot even imagine.
Cyril is never seen being concerned about his mother. Leaving the mother
out of the story leads the viewer naturally to use Samantha to fill that
role. <strong>Cécile de France</strong> plays this role quite
effortlessly, as she discovers slowly that she quite likes having a son
around. Directed by the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dardenne_brothers"><strong>Dardenne
brothers</strong></a>, a Belgian director duo, Le Gamin au vélo is a
sunny and warm look at a tiny slice of childhood. I found the movie to
be a delight and might check out more movies by the Dardenne duo in the
future.</p>
