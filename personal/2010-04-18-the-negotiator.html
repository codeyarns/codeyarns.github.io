<p><strong>Rating</strong>: 3/4 (A decent hostage thriller by Forsyth,
though a bit drawn out)</p>
<p><strong><a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Negotiator_%28novel%29">The
Negotiator</a></strong> by thriller writer <strong><a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Forsyth">Frederick
Forsyth</a></strong> was one of the few books a friend gave me when he
left Singapore. I had not read any books by Forsyth, but he has always
been very popular among my bookworm friends, especially for his book
<strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Day_of_the_Jackal">The
Day of the Jackal</a></strong>.</p>

<p>Though written in 1989, the plot was surprisingly pertinent. In the
book, a new USA president named Cormack takes charge, bringing radical
changes. He even extends an olive branch to the Russian president
Gorbachev, and they agree to cut back drastically on arms. Cormack’s
moves irk the conservative crowd in USA and they devise a devious plot
to take him out of power. Cormack’s son Simon who is studying in London
is kidnapped. Thus enters Forsyth’s hero Quinn, the most famous hostage
negotiator in the world. After a nail biting hostage negotiation, Quinn
is able to get the son released. Just when he thinks he has won, Simon
is killed gruesomely and it is upto Quinn to figure out who did it and
why.</p>
<p><strong>The Negotiator</strong> is quite a good read. The people and
places are well researched and this provides a stable grounding for the
plot. Most of the book, right through Simon’s kidnapping and his hostage
negotiation by Quinn are edge-of-the-seat exciting to read. It is the
last part where Quinn tracks down the killers that is drawn out and
boring. All in all, <strong>The Negotiator</strong> was a decent read
and I would not mind reading <strong>The Day of the Jackal</strong>
after this.</p>
