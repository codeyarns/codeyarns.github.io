<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Tyranny"><strong>On
Tyranny</strong></a> is a tiny book written by <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Snyder"><strong>Timothy
Snyder</strong></a> containing 20 recommendations for citizens to face
up to tyranny. The word <em>tyranny</em> can mean different things to
different people, but this book is focused on facing up to <em>“the
usurpation of power by a single individual or group, or the
circumvention of law by rulers for their own benefit”</em>. Published in
2017 and seemingly updated a few years later, it is actually focused on
what is happening politically in the US at this moment.</p>
<p>The author seems to have expertise in the 1900-1950s rise of
communism and fascism in Europe, how Germans let Hitler rise in power
and stood by watching as he grabbed all power and committed atrocities
on Jews. So, he applies learnings from that part of the world history to
present-day USA and offers 20 succinct recommendations. The book though
has blinders - it does not recognize that dictators or fascists do not
rise in power in a vacuum and that they become an attractive option to
people who have genuine problems in life. So what to do after a tyranny
is prevented - unless a strong alternate solution is visible, the
grieving people are unlikely to be moved.</p>
<p>I liked how dense and distilled the book reads, with every sentence
terse and loaded with gravity. The book is of course a call to action
and with its tiny size is a quick read. Being the size of a pocket book,
it is also an easy book to carry around or gift to people.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/5</p>
