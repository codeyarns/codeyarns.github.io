<p>Stepping into 2012 and looking back, here is a summary of the best
books/movies/TV-series I consumed in 2011. (These media were not
necessarily published/released in the year.) An item appears in this
list if it has remained especially memorable or useful to me or led to
lots of intelligent discussion in this year. I hate Best-of lists which
have a gargantuan 50 or 100 items. So, I have kept these lists as small
as possible, while not restricting myself artificially to a certain
number.</p>
<p><strong>Best Books of 2011</strong></p>
<p>A ho-hum year in books. I read only 13 books and could not make
enough time to read as much as I wanted to.</p>
<p><a
href="http://timefarer.wordpress.com/2011/07/17/peking-diary-1948-1949-a-year-of-revolution/"><strong>Peking
Diary</strong></a>: This is yet another gem from amongst the rare books
I got from a retired professor who returned for good to her ancestral
home in China. This book gives a first-hand experience of living in
China during the revolutionary year of its formation.</p>
<p><a
href="http://timefarer.wordpress.com/2010/12/28/silas-marner/"><strong>Silas
Marner</strong></a>: I read this book again after many years. It remains
a purifying, almost spiritual experience.</p>
<p><a
href="http://timefarer.wordpress.com/2011/12/11/inside-the-machine/"><strong>Inside
the Machine</strong></a>: A great introduction to microprocessors and
computer architecture. The book was an epitome of good analogies,
intuitive explanations, historical narratives and superb
back-of-the-napkin illustrations. Such books give a fuller picture to
the reader and make the knowledge recollectable and shareable. In the
future, I will be on the lookout for such technology/science books.</p>
<p><a
href="http://timefarer.wordpress.com/2011/07/24/weight-training-for-dummies/"><strong>Weight
Training for Dummies</strong></a>: There are thousands of exercises you
can perform using hundreds of kinds of machines and equipments in gyms.
All of this used to be truly intimidating to me, even after using gyms
regularly for 2 years! But after reading this book, I know which parts
of my body to exercise, I can create my own workout routines and I can
do this either with the diverse equipment at a gym or using just the
floor at home. This book is the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_pill_and_blue_pill">red pill</a>
to show you the world of exercises! ;-)</p>
<p><strong>Best Movies of 2011</strong></p>
<p>A pathetic year in movies, I sat through a lot of mediocre
once-watchable movies.</p>
<p><a
href="http://timefarer.wordpress.com/2011/01/22/eradu-kanasu/"><strong>Eradu
Kanasu</strong></a>: This is a classic Kannada romantic drama. They
don’t make ’em like this anymore!</p>
<p><a
href="http://timefarer.wordpress.com/2011/03/26/heartbreaker/"><strong>Heartbreaker</strong></a>:
This French comedy-drama is a thrill ride! We liked it so much, we
watched it again after.</p>
<p><strong>Best TV Series of 2011</strong></p>
<p>I had an unbelievably fantastic time with TV series this year.</p>
<p><a
href="http://timefarer.wordpress.com/2011/02/06/the-wire-season-1/"><strong>The
Wire</strong></a> (Seasons 1-5): If I had to pick only one item for the
year, this would be it. I have spent a prodigious amount of my life
watching American TV series and movies. But, The Wire is Americana quite
like nothing I have seen before. This is the finest TV series I have
ever (yes, e-v-e-r) seen!</p>
<p><a
href="http://timefarer.wordpress.com/2011/07/03/jeeves-and-wooster-series-1-4/"><strong>Jeeves
and Wooster</strong></a> (Series 1-4): Two powerhouse British TV actors
(Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry) in their prime enacting one of the most
enduring and rib-tickling works of British fiction (works of P. G.
Wodehouse). Need I say more?</p>
<p><a
href="http://timefarer.wordpress.com/2011/11/06/game-of-thrones-season-1/"><strong>Game
of Thrones</strong></a> (Season 1): Lush, gorgeous, scary and truly a
world in itself. I cannot wait for Season 2!</p>
<p><a
href="http://timefarer.wordpress.com/2011/05/22/frasier-seasons-1-11/"><strong>Frasier</strong></a>
(Seasons 1-11): Much like the wine Frasier is always tasting, this is a
fine mature comedy, which I was finally able to appreciate.</p>
<p>I hope I will be able to read more good books and have better luck
with movies in 2012. 😊</p>
