<p>How do ordinary people support and participate in extraordinarily
cruel movements like the Holocaust? This is what journalist <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Mayer"><strong>Milton
Mayer</strong></a> tried to find out in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/They_Thought_They_Were_Free"><strong>They
Thought They Were Free: The Germans, 1933-45</strong></a>, by talking to
10 normal people in the small town of Kronenburg a few years after the
Nazis were defeated in World War 2. The people he interviews are truly
working class in the town, such as student, baker, inspector, teacher,
policeman, fireman. Starting from 1933 and until 1945, we see these
people slowly exclude Jews from their social circles, start to agree
with the stereotypes about Jews, participate in the burning down of the
town’s synagogue, turn a blind eye when their Jewish neighbors are sent
away and silently benefit from the property and businesses of the Jews
who are gone.</p>
<p>In these detailed interviews, we see that these people are not
fanatics spewing hatred or venom. However, they truly believed in the
national pride and sense of purpose that the Nazi movement brought,
experienced improvements to their lives after the mismanagement of the
Weimar Republic, and started to believe in the propaganda. We also see
that Hitler turned the screw slowly over the years, little by little,
making the people accept increasingly brutal acts as right. It also
helps that most of the Holocaust brutality happens away from their eyes,
so they are able to turn a blind eye to the disappearances.</p>
<p>With the increasing fascism, racism, nationalism around the world,
this is a very pertinent read. It is a great idea to interview the
actual people who lived through, willfully participated in the Nazi
movement, learnt about the scale of the atrocities after the war ended
and still believed they did no wrong. The author is able to get these
people to open up and share their deepest secrets. However, after the
first section of the interviews, the book spends a lot of time
re-hashing interview content or delving into other content which I found
to be distracting. A shorter tighter book would have had a potent
message.</p>

<h2 id="excerpts">Excerpts</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Man (says Erasmus) learns at the school of example and will attend no
other.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Now I see a little better how Nazism overcame Germany—not by attack
from without or by subversion from within, but with a whoop and a
holler. It was what most Germans wanted—or, under pressure of combined
reality and illusion, came to want. They wanted it; they got it; and
they liked it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I came back home a little afraid for my country, afraid of what it
might want, and get, and like, under pressure of combined reality and
illusion. […] If I—and my countrymen—ever succumbed to that
concatenation of conditions, no Constitution, no laws, no police, and
certainly no army would be able to protect us from harm. For there is no
harm that anyone else can do to a man that he cannot do to himself, no
good that he cannot do if he will. And what was said long ago is true:
Nations are made not of oak and rock but of men, and, as the men are, so
will the nations be.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Foreigners speaking of the “National Socialist Party” miss the point,
said the younger Schwenke; it was the National Socialist German Workers
Party, “the party of the little men like me. The only other was the
Communist.” Emperor and Führer both required the consciousness of
littleness in the Germans, but Führer, bringing bigness down, lifted
littleness up.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When I asked Herr Wedekind, the baker, why he had believed in
National Socialism, he said, “Because it promised to solve the
unemployment problem. And it did. But I never imagined what it would
lead to. Nobody did.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There were two truths, and they were not contradictory: the truth
that Nazis were happy and the truth that anti-Nazis were unhappy.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A good man—even a good American—running to catch a train on an
important assignment has to pass by the beating of a dog on the street
and concentrate on catching the train; and, once on the train, he has to
consider the assignment about which he must do something, rather than
the dog-beating about which he can do nothing. If he is running fast
enough and his assignment is mortally important, he will not even notice
the dog-beating when he passes it by.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The Nazi slogan in 1932 was, If you want your country to go
Bolshevik, vote Communist; if you want to remain free Germans, vote
Nazi.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>My friends wanted Germany purified. They wanted it purified of the
politicians, of all the politicians. They wanted a representative leader
in place of unrepresentative representatives. And Hitler, the pure man,
the antipolitician, was the man, untainted by “politics,” which was only
a cloak for corruption.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What happened here was the gradual habituation of the people, little
by little, to being governed by surprise; to receiving decisions
deliberated in secret; to believing that the situation was so
complicated that the government had to act on information which the
people could not understand, or so dangerous that, even if the people
could understand it, it could not be released because of national
security. And their sense of identification with Hitler, their trust in
him, made it easier to widen this gap and reassured those who would
otherwise have worried about it.</p>
