<p>I was looking for some lighter reads in this stressful COVID period
and based on a friend’s recommendation I picked up the crime thriller <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Snowman_(Nesb%C3%B8_novel)"><strong>The
Snowman</strong></a> by Norwegian author <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jo_Nesb%C3%B8"><strong>Jo
Nesbø</strong></a>. This novel is apparently one of a series built
around the central character, a police detective named <strong>Harry
Hole</strong>. This novel is popular enough that it even has a movie
adaptation. This turned out to be not surprising once I was reading the
book, because it had a Hollywood-like writing and characterization.</p>
<p>Harry Hole is your typical Hollywood burnt-up drunkard detective
genius, who has also lost love. When investigating the disappearance of
a woman he discovers that for several years now married women have been
disappearing after the year’s first snow. And in every one of these
cases, there was a snowman left outside the home. Harry’s boss gives him
a small team (enter <strong>Katrine Bratt</strong> the pretty Hollywood
female sidekick) to find out this serial killer who earns the nickname
<em>The Snowman</em>.</p>
<p>The fun in a crime thriller is to be kept guessing who among the
characters introduced in the book is the real killer. Jo plays the game
quite well to be honest, not quite in the same league as <a
href="2019-03-17-the-devotion-of-suspect-x.html"><strong>Keigo
Higashino</strong></a>, but not bad at all. The Norwegian cold
environment (which was new to me), the cities of Oslo and Borgen, and
the inventive and methodical gruesome murders were all quite engaging.
Three different characters are mistakenly declared as the Snowman before
revealing the real one - this I believe was the weakest point. Due to
this, the novel became longer than necessary and sagged in the second
act, else it would have been just as nail biting as the other two acts.
All in all, this was a fun and fast read, a good pick for light
reading.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 3/4</p>
