<p><strong>Jeff Atwood</strong> mentioned <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_Rush"><strong>Code
Rush</strong></a> in a <a
href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2011/01/lived-fast-died-young-left-a-tired-corpse.html">recent
post</a> and it seemed interesting enough to me to check it out. This
PBS documentary is about the year 1998-1999 in the life of the
<strong>Netscape</strong> company, one of its dying years. Code Rush
follows the key people in Netscape, while they scramble to prepare to
release the source code of Netscape Navigator Communicator 5.0 as the
open-sourced <strong>Mozilla</strong> browser.</p>
<p>Netscape started off with a scorching hot IPO in 1995, but was
reduced to pennies within 3 years when Microsoft shipped Internet
Explorer for free with Windows. Not being able to take Microsoft head
on, Netscape decided to open source their source code, in a bid to
expand their programmer community. The move was heartily welcomed, but
did nothing for the company’s slide. Within a year AOL bought Netscape
and the folks behind it cashed out.</p>
<p>The documentary looks pretty tacky, and is not helped by the mood of
the Netscape folk, which is all round <em>depressing</em>. It is nice to
see <strong>Jamie Zawinski</strong> and <strong>Brendan Eich</strong> at
their desks or at work. Probably the biggest takeaway in Code Rush is to
see the effect of working at a startup on the employees and their
families. Most Netscapers featured admit that they either do not have
<em>any</em> life or it is screwed up by the long hours they put in at
work. <em>“Lived fast, died young, left a tired corpse”</em> as one of
them says.</p>
