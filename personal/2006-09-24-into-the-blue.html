<p>Saw <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0378109/">Into The Blue</a>. Set in the Bahamas, Jared (Paul Walker from The Fast And The Furious) and Sam (Jessica Alba from Sin City) are a poor young couple of divers who dream of making it big by finding a ship wreck. Jared's brother Bryce (a lawyer) and his girlfriend Amanda visit them and they go diving in the waters off the Bahamas. They find the spillage of a wreck and while trying to find the main wreck they come across a recently crashed plane with a cargo full of drugs. Though Bryce/Amanda are interested in selling the drugs and getting rich, Jared/Sam preach them not to and they resume looking for the wreck instead. They soon find the wreck, but their joy is short-lived as the drug lords come after them to get them their sunken cargo.</p>
<p>The movie is directed by John Stockwell, who turns out to be the guy who directed Blue Crush too. If you've seen that eye-popping-beautiful movie (I loved it!), Into The Blue is more of that but underwater. The story is not much, but expect loads of sun, sea and skin. More than half of the 2+ hour movie takes place underwater in a world of turquoise water and white sand beauty filled exotic sea creatures. I give full marks to the video crew of this movie, the underwater world never looked this bright on even NGC. The actors have acted naturally even when surrounded by innumerable sharks, eels and rays. Forget the storyline, watch this movie for the sheer visual pleasure.</p>
