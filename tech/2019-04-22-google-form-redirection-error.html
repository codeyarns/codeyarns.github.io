<h2 id="problem">Problem</h2>
<p>A team member shared a <strong>Google Form</strong> for me to fill out. Strangely that form URL could not open in Firefox. It would not load with this error:</p>
<pre><code>The page isn’t redirecting properly
An error occurred during a connection to docs.google.com.
This problem can sometimes be caused by disabling or refusing to accept cookies.</code></pre>
<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>
<p>I did not have any setting in Firefox to disable or refuse some cookies. So that error was wrong. But it gave a hint that the problem might be caused by cookies.</p>
<p>I went into the Firefox options and deleted all cookies involved with the URL <strong>google.com</strong>. There is no need to delete all cookies, just those that have this URL. Once I did that, the Google Form URL opened correctly.</p>
