<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/4 (The perfect introductory C# book for C and C++ programmers!)</p>
<p>I am most comfortable with C and C++, though it is mostly a love-hate relationship. C# is a modern programming language for the .Net platform and I have wanted to try it for sometime. I looked around for some good books and found most C# books to be horribly written. I mean, anyone can teach the keywords of the language and syntax. What one wants from a book is a deeper introduction. I finally found my match in <a href="http://www.charlespetzold.com/dotnet/"><strong>.Net Book Zero</strong></a> by Charles Petzold. Petzold is a technical author who is legendary for his <strong>Programming Windows</strong> series of books. .Net Book Zero is his book for C and C++ programmers who want to learn C# and .Net.</p>
<p>Call me old fashioned, but I love it when the author says <em>“Close your Visual Studio kid! Let me show you how to write and compile a C# program at the command-line using the <strong>C# compiler</strong> (<strong>csc.exe</strong>). Now, let us disassemble the program using the <strong>IL Disassembler</strong> (ildasm.exe) and examine the IL code the compiler produced for our program.”</em></p>
<p>I used version 1.1 of this book, which is updated only up to C# 2.0. I did not mind this, so the book was perfect for my needs! Petzold quickly glosses over features which work the same in C# as in C and C++. Instead he focuses on features that are new or work in subtly different ways. I especially loved the depth with which <strong>value types</strong> (allocated on the stack) and <strong>reference types</strong> (allocated on the managed heap) are covered all throughout the book. It is this kind of writing that enables a C/C++ programmer to come through this 250+ page book with an in-depth knowledge of how the gears crank underneath C#. The one thing that is missing in this book is a good index. I cannot think of an introductory C# book that is better suited for the C/C++ audience. Highly recommended. Petzold made a mistake sharing the book for free ;-)</p>
<p>The book has some spelling mistakes, I have compiled the errata <a href="https://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=0ATIuuc-MpgWDYWhmNjN2Zjltcjk4XzM1OTV0c2o3cDdr&amp;authkey=CNeehMoB">here</a>.</p>
