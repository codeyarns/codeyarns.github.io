<p><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mavis_Beacon_Teaches_Typing"><strong>Mavis
Beacon Teaches Typing</strong></a> is a classic program to learn touch
typing. These are my observations based on the <strong>Platinum
20</strong> version of this software.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>At first use, it asks you to create a <strong>user</strong> with
your goals - like the words per minute (WPM) and accuracy you want to
achieve. There are also other preferences, such as keyboard type,
newline style and background music. It supports multiple user profiles,
each with other goals and preferences.</p></li>
<li><p>Based on your goal, the program takes you through several levels
of lessons using a main tutor interface and also some games.</p></li>
<li><p>The main tutor interface is perfect: you repeat the text shown at
the top, while at the bottom the specific type of keyboard you chose is
displayed with an animation of the hand-fingers placement for the next
letter. I have used many touch typing programs and the display of the
hand-fingers placement in this program is what I found to be crucial for
my learning.</p></li>
<li><p>In between the lessons, the program puts you in some typing
games: they are very silly, simple and the graphics are frankly terrible
- like a college project made in Adobe Flash.</p></li>
<li><p>In addition to these, as you progress to the final levels you
will also participate in dictation lessons and transcription lessons.
The dictation lessons had some bug, where the audio would skip over to
the next sentence and there was no way to get it back on track. Pressing
<code>Ctrl + R</code> to repeat the sentence did not help. For the
transcription lessons, the transcript can be found in the help
documentation of the program.</p></li>
<li><p>One of my biggest problems with the higher levels is just how
repetitive it got. I plateaued in my learning and subjecting me to the
same 5 passages from some classic English books wasn’t great. It would
have been nicer if they had chosen a vast library of texts from public
domain books.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, I found that this was the only program with which I was
able to learn to touch type correctly, especially the numbers and
special characters. The key to all that was the animated display of
finger placement. The downside of this program was how limited it was in
its teaching capability once I reached a decent speed.</p>
