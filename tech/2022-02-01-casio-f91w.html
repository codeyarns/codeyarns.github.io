<p>I love the simple and geeky digital watches by <strong>Casio</strong> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casio_F-91W"><strong>F-91W</strong></a> is one of my favorites. I have been wearing the F-91W for close to 15 years and I have gone through 3 of them.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Small</strong>: This is one of the smallest watches available. Since I have a small wrist, this is the one of the few watches which fits well.</li>
<li><strong>Lightweight</strong>: This watches weighs like a feather. I could be wearing this for hours and would not notice that it is even there.</li>
<li><strong>Simple</strong>: The watch is simple to operate: it only has time, date, alarm, stopwatch and a light. Changing these is a breeze to figure out by pressing the buttons.</li>
<li><strong>Strap</strong>: The strap is made of resin and is super light and soft. This is the only strap I have found which actually has holes that could fit wrists smaller than mine! This strap is the watch‚Äôs weakest point too - it wears out easily and breaks.</li>
<li><strong>Price</strong>: At just $20, this watch is a no-brainer to get. Due to the strap breaking and general damage, I end up buying a new F-91W when the battery wears out.</li>
<li><strong>Inaccurate</strong>: I found that my F-91W runs about 20 seconds faster per month. I use this watch to join work meetings, so having this is a minor inconvenience. I end up fixing the time on the watch every few months, once it has deviated by a minute. I have not found a solution for this - apparently all digital or analog watches are inaccurate. Casio has watches that can sync to the time signals transmitted in US and UK from atomic clocks - but their reviews were pretty bad.</li>
<li><strong>Replacement straps</strong>: The strap wears out or breaks easily if you use the watch for running or exercise. Replacement straps of all types are available easily on AliExpress. I have tried nato straps, but have come back to the simplicity of the original strap. However, all replacement straps seem to use a metal clasp instead of the plastic used in the original. I find this irritating since the metal bites into my skin.</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, I find this watch to be a must-have for daily wear at home and for running or exercises due to its light weight and small size. I prefer to wear other Casio G-Shock watches for more formal occasions.</p>
