<p>Working with <strong>rectangular blocks</strong> of code is easy in <strong>Visual Studio 2010</strong> and later. The <strong>Alt</strong> key is the key (sic) to work with rectangular blocks of code.</p>
<p>To <strong>select</strong> a rectangular block of code using keyboard, keep Alt pressed along with Shift and arrow keys to select code. To select a rectangular block of code using the mouse, keep the Alt key pressed when you select with left button of mouse.</p>
<p>Once a rectangular block of code is selected, it can be <strong>deleted</strong> by pressing Delete or Backspace.</p>
<p>You will notice that a <strong>vertical line</strong> remains in its place. If you start typing some text here, that text will be added at every line in the block. This trick can be used to add a prefix to many lines of code. That is, while keeping Alt and Shift pressed, use Down arrow key to select the lines where you want to insert. A blue vertical lines appears on these lines. Type any characters and they will be added to every selected line.</p>
<p><strong>Tried with:</strong> Visual Studio 2010</p>
