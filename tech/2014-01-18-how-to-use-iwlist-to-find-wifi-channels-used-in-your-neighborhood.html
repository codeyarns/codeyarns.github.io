<p>The maximum wireless transfer speed that can be achieved between your computer and your wireless router is dependent on which <strong>wireless channels</strong> are being used in your neighborhood. If your wireless router is using a channel that is used by lots of your neighbors then you will experience less speed. So, it is a good idea to check what wireless channels are being used in your neighborhood and pick one that is not used or less used.</p>
<p>You can see the channels being used in your neighborhood using this command:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;code&gt;$ sudo iwlist wlan0 scan | grep Frequency | sort | uniq -c | sort -n
&lt;/code&gt;</code></pre>
<p><code>iwlist</code> in <code>scan</code> mode finds information about all the wireless networks in the neighborhood using the <code>wlan0</code> network interface of your computer. The lines with <code>Frequency</code> have the frequency in GHz and the channel number. <code>sort</code> followed by <code>uniq -c</code> counts the number of networks using the same channel. And finally <code>sort -n</code> rearranges the results in ascending order of channel used.</p>
