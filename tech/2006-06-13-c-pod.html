<p>When programming in C++, mixing up C++ and C data types becomes an
ugly inevitability. It always throws up some quirky behaviour.
<strong>POD</strong> (Plain Old Data) is one of these I discovered
today. C macros can be used unchanged under C++. But, the correct
behaviour under C++ depends on the type of data being operated on. It
needs to be of POD type.</p>
<p>Here is some information about the <em>POD type</em> from the
excellent <a href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/">C++ FAQ
Lite</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[<a
href="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/intrinsic-types.html#faq-26.7">26.7</a>]
What is a “POD type”? A type that consists of nothing but Plain Old
Data. A POD type is a C++ type that has an equivalent in C, and that
uses the same rules as C uses for initialization, copying, layout, and
addressing. As an example, the C declaration struct Fred x; does not
initialize the members of the Fred variable x. To make this same
behaviour happen in C++, Fred would need to not have any constructors.
Similarly to make the C++ version of copying the same as the C version,
the C++ Fred must not have overloaded the assignment operator. To make
sure the other rules match, the C++ version must not have virtual
functions, base classes, non-static members that are private or
protected, or a destructor. It can, however, have static data members,
static member functions, and non-static non-virtual member functions.
The actual definition of a POD type is recursive and gets a little
gnarly. Here’s a slightly simplified definition of POD: a POD type’s
non-static data members must be public and can be of any of these types:
bool, any numeric type including the various char variants, any
enumeration type, any data-pointer type (that is, any type convertible
to void*), any pointer-to-function type, or any POD type, including
arrays of any of these. Note: data-pointers and pointers-to-function are
okay, but pointers-to-member are not. Also note that references are not
allowed. In addition, a POD type can’t have constructors, virtual
functions, base classes, or an overloaded assignment operator.</p>
