<p><strong>Raspberry Pi</strong> running <strong>Raspbmc</strong> is an awesome HTPC. If you have connected your Raspbmc to your home wireless router, it is most probably getting a <strong>dynamic IP address</strong> from it using <strong>DHCP</strong>. This is quite a hassle if you control your Raspbmc using your <a href="http://codeyarns.wordpress.com/2012/08/09/how-to-use-an-android-smartphone-as-a-remote-control-for-raspbmc/">cellphone</a> or <a href="http://codeyarns.wordpress.com/2012/08/09/how-to-control-raspbmc-from-a-browser-of-another-computer/">browser</a> or use <a href="http://codeyarns.wordpress.com/2012/08/11/how-to-ftp-to-your-raspbmc/">FTP</a> or <a href="http://codeyarns.wordpress.com/2012/08/10/how-to-ssh-into-your-raspbmc/">SSH</a> with it, since the IP address keeps changing. Due to these reasons, it is better to assign a <strong>static IP address</strong> to your Raspbmc.</p>
<p>Assigning a static IP address to Raspbmc is easy:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>In XBMC, go to Programs → Raspbmc settings → Wired network configuration.</p></li>
<li><p>Uncheck the <strong>Automatic DHCP</strong> option.</p></li>
<li><p>Provide a static IP address. Make sure the IP address is far away from the IP addresses typically assigned by the router to the networked devices at home. For example, if a router assigns addresses starting from 192.168.0.10, then pick a static IP like 192.168.0.50</p></li>
<li><p>Scroll down and check the Update Now option. Raspbmc will take a few seconds to apply the new configuration.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure you can ping the static IP address you assigned. Voila, your Raspbmc now has a fixed IP address! :-)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Note: Do not muck around with the <code>/etc/network/interfaces</code> file to assign a static IP address. That does not work with Raspbmc.</p>
<p><strong>Tried with:</strong> Raspbmc RC4</p>
