<h1 class="title">Integer division in C</h1>

<p><strong>Integer division</strong> in modern C always rounds towards zero. For example:</p>
<pre><code>9/2 = 4
-9/2 = -4 (not -5)</code></pre>
<p>This was was not always so. In early C versions and in the C89 standard, positive integer division rounded to zero, but result of negative integer division was implementation dependent!</p>
<p>From <strong>§3.3.5 Multiplicative operators</strong> of the <a href="http://port70.net/~nsz/c/c89/c89-draft.txt"><strong>C89 standard</strong></a>:</p>
<pre><code>   When integers are divided and the division is inexact, if both
operands are positive the result of the / operator is the largest
integer less than the algebraic quotient and the result of the %
operator is positive.  If either operand is negative, whether the
result of the / operator is the largest integer less than the
algebraic quotient or the smallest integer greater than the algebraic
quotient is implementation-defined, as is the sign of the result of
the % operator.  If the quotient a/b is representable, the expression
(a/b)*b + a%b shall equal a .</code></pre>
<p>The same appears in the first edition of <strong>The C Programming Language</strong> book by Kernighan and Ritchie.</p>
<p>This implementation-defined behavior was fixed by the C99 standard which defined that integer division always rounds towards zero.</p>
<p>From <strong>§6.5.5 Multiplicative operators</strong> of the <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1256.pdf"><strong>C99 standard</strong></a>:</p>
<pre><code>When integers are divided, the result of the / operator is the algebraic
quotient with any fractional part discarded.</code></pre>
<p>Thanks to Arch for pointing this out.</p>
