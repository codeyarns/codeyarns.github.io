<p><strong>Merge</strong> is a common operation in <strong>Git</strong> to merge the changes in another branch to the current branch.</p>
<p>Here is an example, where we checkout the <code>master</code> branch and merge a <code>feature_branch</code> to it:</p>
<p>[code lang=&quot;text&quot;] $ git checkout master $ git merge feature_branch $ git commit</p>
<pre><code>

In the pictorial depictions above we can see that the two branches are actually merged together in the directed acyclic graph (DAG) with an edge. After this, the `git log` for `master` will show all the commits that are in `feature_branch` too in addition to the commits in `master`.

There might be cases where you do not want to actually merge the two branches. Maybe you just want a single commit on `master` that has all the changes that would have been merged from `feature_branch`. Note that this is different from `git rebase` since that replays all the multiple commits of `feature_branch` on `master`.

The answer to this is `git merge --squash`. This command effectively changes the files such that they would be after a `git merge`. However, there would be no link between `master` and `feature_branch` after this commit is committed.

To merge with squash in the above scenario:

[code lang=&quot;text&quot;]
$ git checkout master
$ git merge --squash feature_branch
$ git commit</code></pre>
<p>When you commit you will see that Git inserts a default commit message that says <code>Squashed commit of the following</code> and lists all the commits from <code>feature_branch</code> that are squashed into this commit. You can delete this commit message and create your own of course.</p>

<p>The pictorial depiction of this operation above shows that there is no link between the two branches after this merge. When you do <code>git log</code> no one can see the multiple commits of <code>feature_branch</code>. You can even safely delete <code>feature_branch</code> if you want to after this operation.</p>
