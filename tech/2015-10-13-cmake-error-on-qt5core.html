<h1 id="problem">Problem</h1>
<p>I tried to build source code that uses <strong>Qt5</strong> using <strong>CMake</strong>. It quit with this error:</p>
<pre><code>CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:20 (find_package):
  By not providing &quot;FindQt5Core.cmake&quot; in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by &quot;Qt5Core&quot;, but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by &quot;Qt5Core&quot; with any
  of the following names:

    Qt5CoreConfig.cmake
    qt5core-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of &quot;Qt5Core&quot; to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  &quot;Qt5Core_DIR&quot; to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  &quot;Qt5Core&quot; provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.</code></pre>
<h1 id="solution">Solution</h1>
<p>I checked for Qt5 packages and they seemed to be installed. There has been a naming change between Qt4 and Qt5 packages in Ubuntu and that threw me off.</p>
<p>What was needed is the package <code>qtbase5-dev</code>. Once I installed it, this error was solved:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo apt install qtbase5-dev</code></pre>
<p><strong>Tried with:</strong> Ubuntu 14.04</p>
