<p>The <strong>Kinect for Windows</strong> sensor can be programmed, controlled and used in your code easily on <strong>Windows</strong>. Getting started is really easy.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The Kinect has a <strong>USB</strong> input and <strong>power</strong> input. Plug the power input to a power socket and the USB input to a USB port on your computer. The light on the Kinect should turn on to <strong>green</strong> color. If the light does not turn on or it is red in color, then something is badly wrong at the hardware level. The green light on the Kinect will <strong>blink</strong> slowly. This is all right since it indicates that the Kinect is not currently controlled by any computer. Though Windows has detected the Kinect device on its USB port, it cannot yet control it because it does not have the necessary Kinect drivers.</p></li>
<li><p>Go to the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/kinectforwindows/"><strong>Kinect for Windows</strong></a> webpage, download the <strong>Kinect for Windows SDK</strong> and install it. This provides the Kinect <strong>drivers</strong> and a library that provides basic access to the output of Kinect. Once this installation is complete, Windows should be able to detect your Kinect and its light should glow green steadily. That is, it should have stopped blinking now.</p></li>
<li><p>It is highly recommended to install the <strong>Kinect for Windows Developer Toolkit</strong>, since this provides higher level libraries, API, sample codes and tools. This can be downloaded from the Kinect for Windows webpage too and installed.</p></li>
<li><p>After installation, it is time to take the Kinect out for a spin! Open **C:FilesSDKsToolkit v1.7.0*. You can see that it is full of binaries of various Kinect programs. Try them out! For example, the <strong>Kinect Explorer</strong> tool should show you the color, depth and audio output of your Kinect.</p></li>
<li><p>To get started on programming the Kinect, head over to **C:FilesSDKsToolkit v1.7.0*. You can see the C++, C# and VB source code of the sample programs here. This should get you started on hacking your Kinect.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Tried with:</strong> Kinect for Windows, Kinect for Windows SDK 1.7, Kinect for Windows Developer Toolkit 1.7.0 and Windows 7 x64</p>
