<h1 class="title">Work with remote directories in VSCode using Remote
SSH</h1>

<p>The <a
href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh"><strong>Remote
- SSH</strong></a> extension makes opening and working with remote
directories just as natural and fully-featured in <strong>Visual Studio
Code</strong> as working with local directories. Once you set it up and
have a remote directory open, you can browse the directory tree, open
any files, find-replace and lookup definitions across all the files.</p>
<p>This is in contrast to the <a
href="2018-05-03-how-to-edit-remote-files-using-remote-vscode.html"><strong>Remote
VSCode</strong></a> extension which made it easy to open individual
files residing on a remote computer using SSH, but was not ideal for
larger-scale work like working on a project or directory of files.</p>
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>To use this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Search for the <strong>Remote - SSH</strong> extension in VSCode and
install it.</li>
<li>Open <strong>Remote Explorer</strong> on the left and choose
<strong>SSH Targets</strong> from the top dropdown. (If you are also
using WSL, you might see <strong>WSL Targets</strong> listed there, but
that is <em>not</em> what we want.)</li>
<li>Click the <code>+</code> to add a new remote directory by providing
the <code>ssh joe@remote123</code> command and then the path on the
remote computer. VSCode will prompt you for the password on the remote
computer.</li>
<li>You should now be able to do everything you could do locally in
VSCode on this remote directory. Even code completion and code
exploration across the files in the directory worked fine in Python and
C++ code for me.</li>
<li>If you open multiple remote directories, you can switch between them
in the Remote Explorer or in the File -&gt; Open Recent section.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="use-without-password">Use without password</h2>
<p>You will notice that VSCode asks for the remote password every time
you open the remote directory or reopen VSCode. To avoid this, we need
to understand how VSCode uses ssh and then provide the ssh client with
an identity file as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Remote - SSH extension uses the SSH client of MacOS and the
OpenSSH Windows client located at
<code>C:\Windows\System32\OpenSSH\ssh.exe</code> on Windows.</li>
<li>It stores its remote computer (not remote directory) configuration
in the file <code>$HOME/.ssh/config</code> on MacOS and
<code>%USERPROFILE%/.ssh/config</code> on Windows.</li>
<li>By default, when you added a single remote computer, it would have
these lines:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>Host 10.110.22.22
  HostName 10.110.22.22
  User joe</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><p>To avoid entering password every time, we need to create a
public-private key pair locally and share the key with the remote
computer, as described <a
href="2016-01-20-how-to-ssh-without-username-or-password.html">here</a>.
I used the ssh inside WSL to create the public-private key pair and then
shared the <code>.pub</code> key with the remote computer.</p></li>
<li><p>To make the VSCode’s SSH client use these <strong>identity
files</strong>, we copy over the private and public key files (for
example <code>id_ed25519</code> and <code>id_ed25519.pub</code>)
generated by the above step to the <code>%USERPROFILE%\.ssh</code>
directory. Or on MacOS the files are already in the right directory.
(Actually, the public key file is not really needed, since we have
already shared it to the remote computer in the earlier step.)</p></li>
<li><p>Specify the private key file that should be used with the remote
computer in the <code>%USERPROFILE%\.ssh\config</code> file:</p></li>
</ul>
<pre><code>Host 10.110.22.22
  HostName 10.110.22.22
  User joe
  IdentityFile C:\Users\joe\.ssh\id_ed25519</code></pre>
<p>Note for Windows: OpenSSH client can only understand the standard
Windows users path <code>C:\Users\joe</code> in the path.</p>
<p>After this setup, you should be able to connect to the remote host
and open directories on it just like they were on the local
computer.</p>
<p><strong>Tried with:</strong> Visual Studio Code 1.47, Windows 10,
MacOS Tahoe 26.2</p>
