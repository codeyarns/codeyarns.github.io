<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IrfanView"><strong>IrfanView</strong></a> is a super-fast super-small image viewer for Windows and has been my default image viewer for two decades now. It was created and is maintained by Irfan Škiljan from Vienna.</p>
<p>I can remember to this day the time I discovered <strong>IrfanView</strong> for the first time. It was my first gig in the software industry around 2002 and Windows and all the software installers were dead-slow on work computers. Looking for an image viewer on the web, I found IrfanView. It had all the features I needed, but what stood out for me was its <em>blazing-fast</em> installation speed. Blink! and it was already done. I am happy to report that it is that fast to this day. And needless to say that it has been my defacto image viewer in all these years and I have even looked for clones of it on Linux, cause it is one of those rare Windows programs that are very capable.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Install:</strong> Download and install from its <a href="https://www.irfanview.com/">homepage</a>. The installation wizard allows you to customize both the install and the configuration files for all users or just the current user. It also allows you to set it as the default viewer for every possible image format - I recommend this.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Paste:</strong> Press <code>Ctrl + V</code> to paste an image that was copied from a different program. I also use this method to paste the desktop screenshot I had captured by pressing <code>Print Screen</code> on the keyboard.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Copy:</strong> Press <code>Ctrl + C</code> to copy the currently open image in IrfanView. It can pasted into any other application after this operation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Resize:</strong> Press <code>Ctrl + R</code> to get the dialog that allows resizing the currently open image in all sorts of ways.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Crop:</strong> Hold down the mouse and draw a rectangle on the currently open image in IrfanView. Press <code>Ctrl + Y</code> after this to crop to that rectangle.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Paint dialog:</strong> Choose Edit -&gt; Paint dialog or press <code>F12</code> to open the dialog that has all the painting tools from the classic MS Paint program. I typically use this to mark something on a screenshot before sharing it with someone.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Batch operations:</strong> Choose File -&gt; Batch Conversion / Rename to apply batch operations to images. For rename, all sorts of numbering can be added as prefix or suffix to the files. Other operations include crop, resize, rotate, flip or almost anything imaginable.</p></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Replicate crop on multiple images:</strong>
<ul>
<li>When a <em>crop rectangle</em> is drawn on the image, its parameters can be seen on the Irfanview titlebar. The first 2 numbers are the coordinates of the <em>origin</em> (top left) and the next two numbers are the dimensions of the crop rectangle.</li>
<li>Choose <em>Edit</em> -&gt; <em>Create custom crop selection</em>. If you have chosen a crop rectangle its parameters will already be displayed. Click on <em>Save current values</em>, click on <em>Apply to image</em> and crop the image. Open the rest of the images and do the same.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
