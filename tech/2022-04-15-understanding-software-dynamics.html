href="https://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Software-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Computing/dp/0137589735"><strong>Understanding
Software Dynamics</strong></a> is a difficult book to define. Written by
<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/dicksites/"><strong>Richard L.
Sites</strong></a>, it is a distillation of his life’s experience in
performance optimization at the hardware-software boundary. It focuses
on the 5 components that affect performance: compute (CPU), memory,
storage, network and critical sections.</p>
<p>Part 1 of the book on <strong>Measurement</strong> looks at each of
the 5 components, summarizing the history behind each and how to write
C/C++ programs to measure their characteristics and performance. I found
the author’s concise history of CPUs, memory, hard disks, SSD, and
Ethernet to be fascinating, discovering many gems that I wasn’t
previously aware of. When writing programs to discover the effects of
these components on performance, we realize how there are multiple
levels of caches in each of these and how compiler optimizations make it
difficult to isolate a specific component.</p>
<p>Part 2 on <strong>Observation</strong> shows the importance of
logging, profiling, dashboards and tracing to monitor and debug
performance. Though primarily aimed at datacenter-scale applications, I
learnt a lot about the programmatic solutions and tools available to aid
this process.</p>
<p>Part 3 was primarily around <a
href="https://github.com/dicksites/KUtrace"><strong>KUTrace</strong></a>,
a kernel-level tool developed by the author and folks at Google. I
skipped this and moved to Part 4 on <strong>Reasoning</strong> which
shows how to reason about performance that is not matching expectations
since the system we built is waiting on CPU, memory, disk, network,
locks, time or queues.</p>
<p>This book came <a
href="https://twitter.com/danluu/status/1488214367946432517">recommended</a>
by Dan Luu and I must admit it fills a real gap in the practical
understanding and debugging of performance issues in today’s accelerated
and datacenter-scale applications and deployments. The author brings his
enormous experience from the days of VAX, DEC Alpha, Google to bear in
his writings and it was great to imbibe that kind of knowledge. If you
are short on time, I highly recommend at least studying Part 1 of this
book, which is where I got most of my value. This is also the part that
overlaps a lot with my other favorite book: <a
href="2012-04-10-computer-systems-a-programmers-perspective-2nd-edition.html"><strong>Computer
Systems: A Programmer’s Perspective</strong></a>. Since the book’s
illustrations focus on cloud applications, I learnt a lot about how
large-scale solutions like GMail/search are distributed among hundreds
of servers and how they communicate using RPCs. The book does miss out
on GPUs, but I think it is easy to migrate these learnings over to such
accelerators, which too have the similar performance constraints.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/4</p>
