<p>In my first few weeks at work, I noticed that my colleague used ear
muffs regularly at our open office workplace. I had recently realized
that blocking external aural stimuli actually helped me focus better
than listening to music. After discussing a while about this, I took the
plunge and got the same one he had: <a
href="https://cleararmor.biz/products/safety-ear-muffs"><strong>Clear
Armor Safety Ear Muffs</strong></a>. That was 4.5 years ago and I am
happy to report that this has turned out to be an indispensible tool in
my work kit.</p>
<p>The typical solution for noise isolation nowadays are active/passive
noise isolation/cancelling headphones, which <a
href="2020-03-16-bose-ae2-soundlink.html">I use regularly too</a>. But,
I found that ear muffs are much simpler and worked better since I do not
really need to listen to music these days.</p>
<p>There is a ton of information online about ear muffs, the varying
levels of noise reduction they provide. The metric they seem to use for
comparison in this field is <em>Noise Reduction Rating (NRR)</em>. The
pair I use is rated at 24 db for NRR and there are products which
provide higher noise reduction. You could study those and decide which
one to buy from among them. But essentially, these are extremely simple
devices which just block out all the sound physically.</p>
<p>The Clear Armor pair was pretty tight and uncomfortable for many
months in the beginning. But I can now wear them easily for an hour or
two. Also, the stems of my glasses do introduce a gap in the muffs,
which is unavoidable, so some external noise does creep in. At our home
with noisy kids, I have taken to wearing these while reading my books
and magazines (which I can do without my glasses). Without glasses, this
does produce a tight seal and I can barely hear anything happening
outside.</p>
<p>In office, wearing these large ear muffs also acted like a clear
indication in our open office that I was working on something and should
not be disturbed.</p>
<p>This is a pretty low-tech solution and I also like that aspect about
it. Another added bonus is that such ear muffs are near in-destructible,
no matter how you drop them, smash them or stretch them. This is another
important factor in homes with brats like mine, who are always actively
destroying expensive headphones.</p>
<p>From my experience, I can say that for working at the computer, to
study, to read books, to focus, I highly recommend having a pair of ear
muffs around. But they definitely take some time to break into. I do not
wear them for multiple hours, but for shorts spans of concentration and
focus: for writing/reviewing a design doc, reviewing an important PR, or
studying a paper.</p>
