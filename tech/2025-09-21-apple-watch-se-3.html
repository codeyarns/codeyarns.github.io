<p><strong>Apple Watch SE 3</strong> is a smartwatch launched by Apple
in 2025. Of the 2 sizes available for this watch, I picked the 40mm case
for my small wrist. I used the watch for a week and decided to return it
due to reasons detailed later below.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Digital crown</strong>: Press to see the watch screen or
Home screen. Double-click to open the App Switcher. Turn to scroll what
is on the screen.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Side button</strong>: Press to use Control Center.
Double-click for Apple Pay. Press and hold to power down or power up the
watch.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Change watch face</strong>: Long press on the watch
face.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>View date and day</strong>: A surprisingly few watch
faces show the date and day. In the default screen, swipe up from the
bottom to see the date and day.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>View widgets</strong>: Swipe up from the bottom.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Silent mode</strong>: Press the side button to open
Control Center. Press the bell icon to enable silent mode. Only
vibrations will be allowed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Get hourly vibration</strong>: On the watch go to
Settings -&gt; Accessibility -&gt; Chimes. Enable Chimes and schedule
for once an hour/30/15 minutes. This plays a sound, but will use a
haptic vibration if the watch is set to silent.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Display the Activity app</strong>: Confusingly the
Activity app is also displayed as Fitness app in some places in the
watch. This app was missing in my watch and it took a while to figure
out why. I had disabled this app on my iPhone and so it was also hidden
on my watch. On the iPhone, go to Settings -&gt; Screen Time -&gt;
Content &amp; Privacy Restrictions -&gt; Allowed Apps &amp; Features and
enable the Fitness app.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sync the alarms from iPhone</strong>: The only alarms
that are synced from iPhone are the special <em>sleep</em> and <em>wake
up</em> alarms. None of the normal alarms from the iPhone are synced to
the phone.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Google TV remote</strong>: On the iPhone, I like
controlling our smart TV using the remote in the Google TV app. It would
have been super useful if the Google TV remote was also available on the
Apple Watch, unfortunately it is not. There is no other means to use a
remote on the watch to control Google TV devices.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="return">Return</h2>
<p>The Apple Watch is a beautifully crafted product, but I felt like its
current version was just not working for me due to these reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Way too much stuff going on with its UI: there are Live Actions,
widgets if you swipe from below, apps if you click the crown and the
Control Center if you click the side button. Just think about it for a
moment - this device display UI has more complexity than MacOS (on
computer) and iOS (on the phone/tablet). I am surprised no one thinks
about this.</p></li>
<li><p>Battery life: Sucks. Apple expects me to wear this all day and
night, but it does not last more than a day - so Apple when do I charge
it? I am absolutely not going to charge a watch every day.</p></li>
<li><p>Step count: All I wanted to track was a step count, but Apple
seems to hate the step count. They have these weird 3 color bars that
show your activity for the day. Just by looking at the color and a
minimalistic icon they have, how am I supposed to know what each color
is tracking? And the step count is always hidden, making you step
through multiple screens to view it. There is no watch face where Apple
will show the step count.</p></li>
<li><p>Strap: I spent an hour at the Apple store and the least worst
strap I could pick was the Nike velcro one. The rubber ones are soft,
but they have a weird clasp that is super hard to use. I cannot fathom
why they could not use the normal clasp used with watches. The leather
and metal ones are all too irritating for my skin, so I avoid those. So,
there we are with Nike velcro and even after a week it still felt itchy
and don‚Äôt even get me started on how ugly this strap is.</p></li>
<li><p>Apps picking is tiresome: You get 2 views of the apps - a
beehive-like hexagonal grid or a scroll list of apps. The hexagonal grid
is irritating, I would have preferred a regular grid (like on the phone)
and bigger icons (they are way too small). The scroll list of apps is
frustrating because while Apple allows me to reorder the hexagonal grid,
I cannot reorder the app list - so I need to scroll in alphabetical
order to reach the bottom apps.</p></li>
<li><p>Widgets: I could not figure out how to control the order of
badges or which apps they are originating from. And Apple suddenly uses
AI to add some Live Actions.</p></li>
<li><p>Crown: This is super hard to use - because in an analog watch you
remove the watch from your wrist to wind it up or change the time using
the crown. Apple borrowed the crown idea without thinking through that
they are making the crown a primary interface though it is hard to turn
it while the watch is on the wrist.</p></li>
<li><p>Scroll: I can scroll with touch on the display, but also with the
crown. Why is the crown there again?</p></li>
<li><p>Shape: I could not get over the chunky squarish shape of the
watch. I prefer a round or hexagonal shape for a watch.</p></li>
</ul>
