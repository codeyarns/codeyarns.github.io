<p><strong>Thinkpad</strong> keyboards have <strong>back</strong>-<strong>forward</strong> keys which activate the back-forward action in browsers. However, they are quite irritating because they are placed right above the right-left arrow keys. Pressing them by mistake could make you lose the text you had painstakingly typed into a web form.</p>
<p>To <strong>disable</strong> these keys in the current session, type these commands at the shell:</p>
<pre><code>$ xmodmap -e &quot;keycode 166=&quot;
$ xmodmap -e &quot;keycode 167=&quot;</code></pre>
<p>To permanently disable them, create a <strong>.Xmodmap</strong> file in your home directory and add these lines to it:</p>

<p>Note: This does not work in Ubuntu 14.04, where xmodmap has been replaced with xkb. I do not know of a solution to get this working on that version of Ubuntu.</p>
<p><strong>Tried with:</strong> Thinkpad X201i and Ubuntu 12.04 LTS</p>
