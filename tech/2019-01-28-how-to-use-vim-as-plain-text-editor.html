<p><strong>Vim</strong> is not only useful for code, but also as a general plain text editor. This is useful for writing README files, Markdown files or if you like publishing plain text file content.</p>
<p>In plain text files, a desirable property is to have lines wrapped at a certain width. The general <strong>wrap</strong> feature of Vim is meaningful only for code which has long lines. This option just wraps the long line visually to the screen width.</p>
<p>To use Vim as a plain text editor you want it to automatically breaks lines at a certain width as you type. You want it to do that only at word boundaries. The option that enables this mode is <strong>textwidth</strong>. For source code, this feature is disabled and is set to 0.</p>
<p>To enable Vim to set a maximum width for text that is inserted, set this option: <code>:set textwidth=80</code></p>
<p>If you have existing text that was not set to this width or you have shortened some lines all of that can be fixed too: mark them visually and press <code>gq</code>.</p>
<p>A final feature needed from a plain text editor is to be able to center a line. This is useful for example for titles and section headings. To do that, mark that line visually and type <code>:center</code>. This only works if the textwidth option is set.</p>
<p><strong>Tried with:</strong> Vim 8.0 and Ubuntu 18.04</p>
