<p><strong>Linux Foundation</strong> had a <a href="http://www.linux.com/news/special-feature/linux-developers">special feature</a> with interviews with 30 developers associated with the Linux kernel. A few points from those interviews that I found interesting:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Most of them work with no music. Or when they do its mostly ambient non-vocal music.</p></li>
<li><p>Most of them work with simple terminals. They don't care about GUI. Many of them surprisingly use simple and old editors like <code>joe</code> and <code>nedit</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>The kernel developers are spread around the world. Most of them work from home living in their home cities.</p></li>
<li><p>Most of them attend as little conferences as possible. They spend their time focused on their work.</p></li>
</ul>
