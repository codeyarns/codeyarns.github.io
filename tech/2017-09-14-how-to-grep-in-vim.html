alt=" " /> When you are editing files in <strong>Vim</strong>, you might
feel like finding out which other files have a certain text. Vim has
such <strong>grep</strong> features built into it to support this usage.
There are many popular Vim plugins that offer similar features, but you
might want to first examine what Vim grep offers. In my opinion, most
users should find the grep features built inside Vim to be quite
adequate for their use.</p>
<p>Right off the bat, you need to know that there are two types of grep
that are available in Vim: <strong>internal grep</strong> and
<strong>external grep</strong>.</p>
<p>And you should remember that all grep operations operate from the
<strong>present working directory (PWD)</strong> of Vim. You can check
what is the PWD using the command <code>:pwd</code>. So, it is to your
advantage to invoke Vim from the base directory of a code base.</p>
<h2 id="internal-grep">Internal grep</h2>
<p>This is the grep feature that is implemented inside Vim. Not
surprisingly, this internal grep is far easier to use compared to Unix
grep. However, it is also noticeably slower compared to Unix grep, for
obvious reasons. However, the ease of use of internal grep is so high
that I tend to prefer it over external grep.</p>
<p>The command to invoke internal grep is <code>:vimgrep</code>. But,
you can use the short form <code>:vim</code>. Yeah this is the one
command that won the Vim lottery to have the same name as the editor!
😄</p>
<p>This command in its most common form takes two arguments: the pattern
to search for and which files to search for.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>To search for <code>Xanadu</code> in all the files in the PWD:
<code>:vim Xanadu *</code> This shows all the search results in a
<strong>Quickfix window</strong> at the bottom and Vim jumps to the
first match right away. You can navigate through this window and press
Enter on search results to jump to them.</p></li>
<li><p>To <strong>recurse</strong> the directories or files in Vim, you
have this strange wildcard called <strong>star-star wildcard</strong>.
For example, to search recursively in all files and directories in PWD:
<code>:vim Xanadu **</code></p></li>
<li><p>Once you are comfortable with the star-star wildcard, you will
find it very convenient to use:
<code>:vim Xanadu ../include/**/*.h</code></p></li>
<li><p>One trick I like to use a lot is to search for the current word
under the cursor in the files. I first press <code>*</code> so that the
word is selected. Then I use this <strong>empty pattern</strong> to
search for it: <code>:vim // *.cpp</code></p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="external-grep">External grep</h2>
<p>External grep is nothing but Vim invoking the commandline grep in a
shell child process. This is super dumb: Vim just invokes whatever you
pass it verbatim and grabs the grep output, parses it and fills it in
the Quickfix window.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>To search in all files in the PWD:
<code>:grep Xanadu *</code></p></li>
<li><p>To search recursively in all files and directory under the PWD:
<code>grep -R Xanadu *</code> Note how the recursive search is far
easier to invoke in the internal grep.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="quickfix-window-trick-to-browse-code">Quickfix window trick to
browse code</h2>
<p>No matter whether you use internal or external grep, its results are
filled in the Quickfix window. As you do new searches, new Quickfix
windows are created and the latest one is displayed at the bottom. You
can move through this list of Quickfix windows using the
<code>:colder</code> and <code>:cnewer</code> commands.</p>
<p>With these grep features and Quickfix window history Vim can be used
as an rudimentary IDE to examine a code base: use the grep commands to
search for text (variables, methods or classes) and jump to them. And
you can move back and forth in this investigation using the Quickfix
window commands described above.</p>
<p><strong>Tried with:</strong> Vim 7.4 and Kubuntu 16.04</p>
