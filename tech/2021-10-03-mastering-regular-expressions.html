<p>An interesting <a
href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1748853">question</a> about
whether the Python regex engine uses a DFA or a NFA led me to finally
read the classic <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Regular-Expressions-Jeffrey-Friedl/dp/0596528124/"><strong>Mastering
Regular Expressions</strong></a> book by <a
href="http://regex.info/">Jeffrey Friedl</a>. I knew Friedl earlier from
his <a href="http://regex.info/blog/">blog</a> where he has been sharing
posts from his travels across Japan for years now. Turns out that he is
also the author of the best known book on regex. The 3rd (and latest)
edition of the book is from 2006, so a bit long in the tooth, but then
regex has not really changed much (I guess).</p>
<p>I have been using regex since forever, regularly in grep and Vim, and
rarely when I need to add a regex pattern in Python or C++. And in all
these years, it has always seemed like a mystery. I am always wondering
if the regex I wrote is minimal, optimal, would it pick what I wanted
and not pick what I don’t want. I think what I really should have done
years ago was to look at the regex language comprehensively and know the
lay of the land, know the boundaries and know what is or is not possible
by regex. And that is precisely what this book fulfilled
beautifully.</p>
<p>Friedl uses a lot of examples all through the book to teach the regex
language, its internal implementation, optimizations and regex use in
languages like Perl, Java and PHP. First comes the basic literals,
metacharacters (like <code>^</code> and <code>$</code>), quantifiers
(<code>?</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>+</code>) and character class
<code>[]</code> of the regex language. He shows how the character class
and its metacharacters form a sub-language of their own in regex. It was
nice to learn features I was not fully aware of like interval
quantifiers (<code>{min, max}</code>) and backreferencing. Finally, I
had no idea regex could have non-capturing parenthesis
(<code>(?:)</code>) and capture positions in the text using the
lookahead and lookbehind metasequences.</p>
<p>The book also gets into the DFA, NFA (and the confusing POSIX NFA)
implementations of regex. Essentially, DFA cannot be used to implement
the more modern features of regex, takes more time and memory to
compile, but is fast during runtime. NFA can do all features of regex,
is fast to compile, but slower during runtime. I felt that this
particular chapter was the weakest in the book, was extremely verbose
and use of DFA/NFA figures (like from the <a
href="2019-10-17-compilers-principles-techniques-and-tools.html">Dragon
Book</a>) instead of text would have helped a lot.</p>
<p>My favorite chapter was on optimizations. It was interesting to see
how regex has pretty much the same traditional optimizations you see in
compilers like constant folding, loop unrolling and such. This chapter
had lots of examples and guidelines on how to speed up your regex
patterns.</p>
<p>The last few chapters focus on the origin of regex and regex in the
Perl, Java, .Net and PHP languages. Though regex owes its name and
syntax to Kleene’s <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleene_algebra">regular sets</a>, it
was practically applied for text pattern searching by Ken Thompson in
1968 and then down through his <strong>ed</strong> editor to
<strong>grep</strong> (global regular expression print), awk, sed and
then Perl. Perl seems to be the language that loves regex the most - it
is the only one where regex is a core part of the language itself, right
from version 1. The rest of the languages have regex support through
their standard library. I mostly skipped these chapters since I don’t
use these languages. I would have loved it if there had been chapters on
grep or Python.</p>
<p>All in all, this book was a gem. Friedl is not only a regex guru, he
is a funny guy too, and so the book was a lot of fun to read. I think it
gave me enough knowledge to know what is and is not possible with regex.
I learnt a lot of new features in the regex language and discovered a
lot of mistakes I typically make. Minor quibbles are that the book could
have been less verbose and addition of DFA/NFA diagrams and Python would
be a good update for the next edition, if that ever happens.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/4</p>
