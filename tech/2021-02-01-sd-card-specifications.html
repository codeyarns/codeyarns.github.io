<h1 class="title">SD Card Specifications</h1>

<p>Recently, I had to choose microSD cards for my car‚Äôs <strong>Yi Mini dash camera</strong> and when I plugged in an old microSD card it spewed an error demanding a <em>UHS SD card</em>. And I also had to choose a suitable microSD card for my <strong>Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+</strong> board so that it would be fast enough to <a href="2021-01-31-how-to-install-ubuntu-on-raspberry-pi.html">use as a Ubuntu system</a>. When I looked into buying microSD cards for these two applications, I realized I had no idea what the various symbols on the cards meant.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the <a href="https://www.sdcard.org/"><strong>SD Card Association</strong></a> has a good website that clearly explains what the symbols mean. Collected below is a summary of what I learnt from looking at the Developer information and the SD Standard v8.0 specification:</p>

</figure>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.sdcard.org/developers/sd-standard-overview/capacity-sd-sdhc-sdxc-sduc/">Capacity classes</a>: SD (2GB or less, FAT12/16), SDHC (2-32GB, FAT32), SDXC (32GB-2TB, exFAT), SDUC (2-128TB, exFAT).</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.sdcard.org/developers/sd-standard-overview/bus-speed-default-speed-high-speed-uhs-sd-express/">Bus speeds</a>: Default Speed (12.5MB/s), High Speed (25MB/s), UHS-I (50/104 MB/s), UHS-II (156/312 MB/s), UHS-III (312/624 MB/s), SD Express (985/1970/3940 MB/s). This is the speed of the bus used to talk to the SD card, so it sets the upper bound of any random/sequential read/write speeds of operations on the card. The highest bus speed cards I found online were UHS-I. This is not surprising since UHS-II/III and SD Express cards apparently have 2/3 rows of pins on the card (so the card reader interface is different from earlier) and need PCIe bus instead of SD bus (so the interface between reader/controller to the CPU would be different too). But these UHS-II/III and SD Express cards seem to be designed so that they will still work with older read/writers.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.sdcard.org/developers/sd-standard-overview/speed-class/">Speed classes</a>: Constant minimum sequential write speed for video recording without frame dropping - Speed Class (2, 4, 6, 10 MB/s), UHS Speed Class (1: 10MB/s, 3: 30MB/s), Video Speed Class (V6: 6MB/s, V10: 10MB/s, V30: 30MB/s, V60: 60MB/s, V90: 90MB/s). This is the class to look for if you intend to use the card for photo/video recording, like for my car dashcam for example.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.sdcard.org/developers/sd-standard-overview/application-performance-class/">Application Performance Class</a>: For general app performance (not just photo/video recording), for example in smartphones - A1 (min random read: 1500 IOPS, min random write: 500 IOPS), A2 (min random read: 4000 IOPS, min random write: 2000 IOPS). The Input/Output Ops per second (IOPS) are with 4KB sized datum. Both classes have sustained sequential write speed of at least 10MB/s. This is the class to look for if you intend to use the card for general applications like in smartphones or like I intended to use in RPi.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.sdcard.org/developers/sd-standard-overview/low-voltage-signaling/">Low Voltage Signaling</a>: SD cards used 3.3V, but smaller 7-10nm process technology means using lower 1.8V. This LV symbol on device indicates that it <em>only</em> uses LV cards. Cards with LV symbol will continue to support 3.3V for backwards compatibility.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/pls/">SD Spec v8.0 Part 1 Physical Layer</a>: This standard document is where I looked up how the random read/write IOPS and the sustained sequential write speeds are measured.</p></li>
</ul>
