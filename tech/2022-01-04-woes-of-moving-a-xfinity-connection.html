<h1 class="title">Woes of moving a Xfinity connection - a tragedy in 3
acts</h1>

<p>Despite living in the Silicon Valley, most homes here realistically
have a single internet provider - <strong>Xfinity</strong>. I had to
move recently, and being stupid I thought that instead of using the
<strong>moving</strong> option on the Xfinity portal, I would create two
separate transactions with Xfinity: create a new connection at new
address on date X, and disconnect old connection at old address on date
X+3. I had a chat with a human agent and confirmed these two
transactions - and they said it was all scheduled.</p>
<h2 id="act-1-internet-seems-to-work-out-of-the-box">Act 1: Internet
seems to work out of the box!</h2>
<p>So, I moved on date X, hooked up my old cable modem at the new
address and it had internet! Now this was suspicious, since Xfinity
usually needs you to get the new connection activated at a new address.
And lo behold, the Xfinity customer portal was still showing a single
address - my old address. So, their system was recognizing this
connection (though at a new address) as my old one - probably using the
MAC address of the modem to do that. This connection would cease in X+3
days, so I had to get the new connection activated soon.</p>
<h2 id="act-2-deactivating-the-old-connection">Act 2: Deactivating the
old connection</h2>
<p>I thought that migrating over my connection would be simple - so
started a chat with a human agent. Not surprisingly, there was a
problem, a big one - no one knew how to help me. The agents started
transferring me between multiple departments inside Xfinity since
apparently they had no idea how to handle my case. After an incredible
<strong>1+ hour phone call</strong>, multiple online chats with
transfers between multiple departments with agents sounding like they
were in different countries (US, Filipino, Indian accents), we had
together figured out these things:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, my connection had to be deactivated in their system.</li>
<li>But, since I had put in an activation with overlapping dates, the UI
used by customer service agents could not do the above.</li>
<li>I was transferred around departments until the <em>real</em> folks
with hooks into the <strong>database</strong> were able to deactivate my
connection.</li>
</ul>
<p>I was informed that my deactivation worked (and indeed my cable modem
lights were red now) and all I had to do now was to get my modem
activated - a simple operation?</p>
<h2 id="act-3---the-climax-activating-the-new-connection">Act 3 - the
climax: Activating the new connection</h2>
<p>I started a chat with a human agent again to activate a new
connection at my new address with my existing cable modem. This is where
they ask you for the cable modem model and MAC address and enable
internet access for that device. And this is where things got
weirder.</p>
<p>The person said that my <strong>Netgear CM500</strong> was not
appearing for me in their system UI, the closest match was a
<strong>CM500V</strong>. Note that the CM500 is a popular cable modem in
the US and is supported by Xfinity. It was working fine one day ago with
their system!</p>
<p>Furthermore, the system was asking for both a CM MAC and a MTA MAC
address for this device. The latter MTA MAC address is only available on
a cable modem with voice support - to hook up a landline. Since I could
not provide a MTA MAC address, the system was not letting them proceed
with activation!</p>
<p>At this point, the agent had no idea what to do - they suggested
taking my modem and driving to the nearest Xfinity store to get it
activated. I knew that there would no difference between the software
systems used by the agent or the store, but still I ended up doing this
in the night just before the store closed. The same thing happened with
their software system and the store guy gave up.</p>
<p>Just when I was headed out of the store, he finally consulted with a
more geeky-looking store guy (glasses and a real air of experience) and
he rubbed his chin - and told me that the activation with an existing
non-Xfinity modem would work if I waited <strong>one more day</strong>.
Apparently, he had seen this happen before.</p>
<p>I thought about it on the drive home and it made sense - the
<strong>rats nest of legacy software systems</strong> hooked up together
at Xfinity was not showing my modem model (only for me) because some
shared databases must not have been synced up yet and sometimes
databases in large legacy organizations are synced once a day.</p>
<p>I waited 24 hours and lo behold on my next chat with a human agent,
the CM500 modem was now magically appearing in their dropdown and they
were able to add just my MAC address (none of the MTA MAC nonsense).
Internet was working in a few minutes!</p>
<h2 id="lessons-learnt">Lessons learnt</h2>
<p>Lessons learnt with Xfinity:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the moving option from Xfinity portal for your move, do not
setup something manually. They will say they can handle it, but their
creaky internal software cannot.</li>
<li>If you do not use Xfinity’s own modems, moving an existing modem or
a modem bought from someone will be painful. There will be remnants of
the modem’s MAC address left in their systems that need to be cleansed
and then the new connection added in.</li>
</ul>
