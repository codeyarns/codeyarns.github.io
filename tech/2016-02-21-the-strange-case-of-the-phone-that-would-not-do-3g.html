<h2 id="problem">Problem</h2>
<p>I got a <strong>data SIM</strong> to access the <strong>HSPA+/3G</strong> mobile data network on my <strong>Moto G2 (XT1068)</strong>. Prior to this, I had never connected to any type of data network on my phone. To my surprise, I found that the phone would only get a measly <strong>GPRS</strong> or <strong>EDGE</strong> connection on this SIM! However, the same SIM inserted into another XT1068 and other phones got a HSPA+ connection without any problem.</p>
<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>
<p>I tried everything imaginable to figure out why only my phone could get a HSPA+ connection. Some of things I tried that did not work:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Configure the cellular connection configuration parameters manually.</p></li>
<li><p>Trying both the SIM1 and SIM2 slots. In reality, both of them should support 3G.</p></li>
<li><p>Factory reset of the phone.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I was at my wit's end when I thought of one final scenario. The phone had never connected to a data connection before. It has started out with Android 4.4.4 (KitKat) and had been OTA upgraded to Android 5.0.2 (Lollipop). Knowing how buggy software can be, I imagined a scenario where the upgrade was buggy enough to disable some variables of data connection since the phone had never done data before.</p>
<p>To try this final solution, I downgraded the phone back to KitKat as described <a href="2016-02-21-how-to-downgrade-xt1068-to-kitkat.html">here</a>. I booted into KitKat and lo behold I got a HSPA+ connection on the data SIM! The phone then OTA upgraded again to Lollipop. However, this time it did not lose any data connection and I still had HSPA+/3G after the upgrade!</p>
