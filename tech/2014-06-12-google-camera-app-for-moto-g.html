<p>When I recently updated some apps from the Play Store, I noticed there was a <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.GoogleCamera">Google Camera app</a> available for the Moto G. It has a colorful icon and seemed to offer a nicer UI than the Motorola Camera app that is default on the Moto G. Other than the UI, the app offers three features: Photo Sphere, Lens Blur and Panorama. Since Moto G does not have a gyro sensor, of the three only the Lens Blur will work on it.</p>
<p><strong>Lens Blur</strong> gives you the shallow DoF of a prime lens. It is for objects that lie close by and you need to slowly move the phone in a circular arc over the object. The effect is nice, but I did not find this feature compelling enough to keep the app. Moreover, this app does not seem to have been tested well on Moto G since the exposure setting just did not work!</p>
<p><strong>Tried with:</strong> Google Camera 2.2.024, Android 4.4.3 and Moto G</p>
