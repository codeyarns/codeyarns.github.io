<h1 class="title">Review of Dell S2415H</h1>
<p class="date">üìÖ Published on: 2016-Sep-10</p>
</header>
<p>It has been 6 months since I started using the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dell-S2415H-24-Inch-LED-Lit-Monitor/dp/B00M9B3XZW"><strong>Dell S2415H</strong></a> display at both home and work. The S in Dell displays is the budget series compared to the premium U series. I have been very happy with what I got for the price and I can no longer imagine working at my tiny notebook display anymore!</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Size</strong>: As you might guess from the model number, this is a <strong>24-inch</strong> display. It looks smaller than one though because it has almost zero bezel. Once you use such an edge-to-edge display, you cannot go back to thick bezels. An added advantage of zero bezel is it is great for dual and multi-display setups cause it gives you the feel of a huge display.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Resolution</strong>: 1920x1080. Not as high as I would like, but fine for my coding and browsing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Inputs</strong>: HDMI and VGA. This is where Dell really cut down on the features. No DVI or Displayport! I do not play games and my notebook and graphic cards have HDMI and VGA outputs, so I am fine.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Color</strong>: This is where IPS really shines through. Everything looks rich and vivid. The color gamut is great and the brightness even at the lowest brightness setting is way high. I actually wish Dell had provided lower brightness levels cause using this display in dark room at night is hard on the eyes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Glossy</strong>: This is one of my biggest problems with this display. It is very very glossy. It looks great to visitors and in photos. But a pain while working, especially if you are working with black terminals or themes. Note that the U series display are sensibly matte and do not have this problem.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Stand</strong>: The stand is dead simple and the only rotational alignment that can be done is along the horizontal axis. Not a problem for me cause I just place it on thick books to increase its height.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Price</strong>: It is very affordable. I doubt you can get a better deal on an IPS display with such a color gamut, good color calibration and such brightness levels. If you can afford it, you should definitely go for the U series displays, cause they are worth the extra cash.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Linux</strong>: I use the display with Kubuntu and it was detected correctly in its settings and works fine.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In conclusion, this is a good display from Dell and I am loving it. If you can afford it, I highly recommend the U series, which also I use regularly.</p>
