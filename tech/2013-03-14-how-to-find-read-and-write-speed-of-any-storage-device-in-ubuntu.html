<p>You do not need to rely on the <strong>read</strong> and <strong>write</strong> speeds provided by a hard disk, USB flash drive or SD card manufacturer. It is quite easy to figure out by yourself the sustained read or write speed of any storage device in Ubuntu.</p>
<p>Make sure your storage device is plugged in, has a filesystem and is mounted under Ubuntu. Assume it is mounted at <code>/media/my-usb-disk/</code> To find the write and read speeds, we write and read a 100MB file to and from a directory of this storage device using the dd command.</p>
<pre><code>$ dd if=/dev/zero of=/media/my-usb-disk/speed-test-file bs=100K count=1k
$ dd if=/media/my-usb-disk/speed-test-file of=/dev/null bs=100K count=1k
$ rm /media/my-usb-disk/speed-test-file</code></pre>
<p>Replace the location of the speed test file with any directory inside the storage medium you are testing. Also, remember to delete the speed test file once you are done.</p>
<p><strong>Tried with:</strong> Ubuntu 12.04 LTS</p>
