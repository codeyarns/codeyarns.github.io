<p>I was looking for an Android app to view the EXIF information of photos taken on my Moto G smartphone. I tried the following apps:</p>
<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mikufu_works.exifviewer">Exif Viewer</a> was the best among the lot. The GUI is clean and the information is displayed nicely below a small preview of the photo. The one nagging problem I have with this app is that it displayed shutter speed as a fraction of 10000, which is simply meaningless to me.</p>
<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ohakado.exifviewx">Jpeg Exif Viewer</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.almyz125.exifextractor">Simple Exif Viewer</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teapps.exiftagviewer">EXIF Tag Viewer</a> have ugly black GUI. They do not even display the image whose EXIF tags are being shown. I did not like these apps.</p>
<p>In the end, I did not pick any of these apps. I would have chosen Exif Viewer, if it did not have that Shutter Speed display problem. It turns out that the Motorola Camera app in the Moto G can display the most important EXIF information anyway: aperture, shutter speed and ISO. Just open any photo, click once on it to get the top menu, choose Options and then Details to view the EXIF information.</p>
<p><strong>Tried with:</strong> Motorola Camera 3.2.54.1, Android 4.4.3 and Moto G</p>
