<p class="date">üìÖ 2022-Nov-21 ‚¨© ‚úçÔ∏è Ashwin Nanjappa ‚¨© üè∑Ô∏è <a href='index.html#youtube'>youtube</a> ‚¨© üìö <a href="index.html">Archive</a></p>

<p><a href="https://newpipe.net/"><strong>NewPipe</strong></a> is a privacy-focused Youtube video app for Android. It is useful to users who want to watch videos, avoid ads, keep their own list of channels/subscriptions without giving that data to Google. It is similar in intention to the <a href="2022-11-21-freetube.html"><strong>FreeTube</strong></a> app for Windows/Linux.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Source:</strong> In addition to Youtube, this app also supports other similar sources such as SoundCloud, BandCamp and a few others no one uses. Press the ‚ò∞ and choose the source you want from the dropdown under the NewPipe name.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>üî• Trending:</strong> This shows a random list of trending videos from Youtube. Not sure how this list is generated and I have never used this.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>üì∫ Subscriptions:</strong> This shows your **channel groups* and the individual channels you are subscribed to. All the channels you manually (or imported) subscribed to are collected under the <em>All</em> channel group here. I find it useful to create other channel groups (like comedy, national news, local news etc.) and add the already-subscribed channels to a channel group. Clicking on the channel group shows the latest videos from that channel group.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>‚ñ∂ What‚Äôs New:</strong> This shows a combined list of all new videos from all the channels you are subscribed to. This is essentially what the <em>All</em> channel group in Subscriptions shows too.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>üîñ Bookmarked Playlists:</strong> This is empty until you start <em>adding</em> individual videos to playlists. The first time you to try to add a video it will ask you to create a playlist with a new name. I add videos to a <em>To Watch</em> list and catch up on those videos under this section.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Video playback options:</strong> When a video is playing there are options at the top that allow you to change the playback speed and switch to different chapter (if chapters are present in the video). At the bottom of the app window, you can switch between comments, similar videos and video info (from left to right).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Import Youtube channels/subscriptions</strong>: Due to the privacy-focused design of the app, there is no direct importing of your Google/Youtube account in this application. Instead follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to <a href="https://takeout.google.com/"><strong>Google Takeout</strong></a> and export your Youtube subscriptions. Google will make it available to you as a CSV file.</li>
<li>Go to Subscriptions in the NewPipe app, choose ‚ãÆ at the top-right corner and choose Import from -&gt; Youtube. Import the CSV file you had obtained from Google Takeout.</li>
<li>Once imported, you will find all the recent videos from your channels listed under Subscriptions under the <em>All</em> channel group.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Sync to other NewPipe instances</strong>: Since I use NewPipe on my phone and tablet, it would have been convenient to sync my subscriptions and channel groups between the devices. Sadly there does not seem to be a way to do this.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sync to FreeTube</strong>: I use FreeTube on Windows for the same reason I use NewPipe on Android. It would have been convenient to sync my subscriptions and channel groups between Android and Windows. Sadly there does not seem to be a way to do this.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Android TV</strong>: Though it does not seem to support Android TV officially, I found that I could install using F-Droid and use this app on Android TV. The UX/controls are terrible to use though since this app assumes it is being used with a touch device. Especially there is no way to view video in full screen by default and making it full screen every time explicitly takes a few clicks. (Note that to get from the seeking to full-screen button, you need to press <em>down</em> on the remote, not <em>right</em>.)</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tried with:</strong> NewPipe 0.24.1</p>
