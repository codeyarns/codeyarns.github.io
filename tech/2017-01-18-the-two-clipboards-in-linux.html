<p>If you have come to Linux from Windows or Mac, you might have observed some strange behavior when copying or pasting content. This confusing behavior is caused because there are usually <strong>two clipboards</strong> in Linux.</p>
<h1 id="x-clipboard">X clipboard</h1>
<p>The X window system has its own clipboard. It is also known as a cutbuffer. Any text or content you mark by highlighting with the mouse cursor is automatically copied to this clipboard. This is known as the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xterm#Copy_and_paste"><strong>PRIMARY selection</strong></a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_selection"><strong>X Window selection</strong></a> or just <strong>selection</strong> in X jargon. When you middle-click the mouse cursor at the destination location, this copied content is pasted there.</p>
<h1 id="window-manager-clipboard">Window manager clipboard</h1>
<p>In addition to the X clipboard, your window manager or desktop environment (like KDE or GNOME) typically maintains its own clipboard. It might even have a clipboard manager which can maintain a historical buffer of content copied to the clipboard.</p>
<p>Typically, text or content is copied to this clipboard when you highlight it and use the keyboard shortcut <code>Ctrl+C</code> or right-click with mouse and choose <strong>Copy</strong>. Content from this clipboard is pasted when you use the keyboard shortcut <code>Ctrl+V</code> or right-click with mouse and choose <strong>Paste</strong>.</p>
<h1 id="syncing-clipboards">Syncing clipboards</h1>
<p>Typically, the window manager or its clipboard manager will have an option that allows you to sync this clipboard with the X window selection clipboard. That is, content copied in either clipboard appears in the other ready for pasting.</p>
