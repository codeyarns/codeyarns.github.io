<p>The <strong>universal remote</strong> is a gadget you wonder how you
lived without once you get it. With 4 remote controls (both Bluetooth
and infrared) and kids, the situation was getting out of hand in the
living room. After looking at the available solutions, I bought the <a
href="https://www.sofabaton.com/"><strong>SofaBaton U2</strong></a>. My
primary requirement was that the remote needs to support both infrared
devices (TV, soundbar and DVD player) and Bluetooth devices (NVIDIA
Shield).</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Pairing with phone</strong>: All the configuration of the
remote is done using its phone apps (<a
href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sofabaton/id1456346952">iPhone</a>
or <a
href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=www.romateck.com.u1">Android</a>).
Press and hold the <code>-</code> and <code>E</code> buttons at the
bottom and the phone app will request to pair with the remote. Once this
is done, you can add the various devices in the room you want to control
with the remote.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Adding bluetooth device</strong>: To add a Bluetooth
device, put the remote in pairing mode (see above) and pair to it from
the device (like smart TV/media player) and add it as a remote.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Adding infrared device</strong>: To add an infrared
device, search the device brand and model in the SofaBaton library. It
will download the codes for the device into the remote. You can also
customize the icon and name for the device displayed on the remote. Note
that before confirming addition of the device, the app suggests you try
pressing the remote buttons to test. <strong>This did not work for
me.</strong> However, once I ignored this error and went ahead and added
the device, the remote worked fine with the device.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Using the remote</strong>: Scroll the wheel at the top to
highlight the device you want to use. Point the remote at the device and
press the buttons to control it. Operating the remote is that simple
once it is setup!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Manual programming</strong>: Since I could not find the
exact model in the library, I tried programming the remote manually.
This involves keeping the original IR remote and the SofaBaton pointed
at each other and pressing the IR key for SofaBaton to detect and add.
This always failed. I gave up on this and just added the models in the
library that looked close enough to mine and those codes worked
fine.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>U1</strong>: Reading the review for the older U1, users
mentioned difficulties in adding batteries, programming the remote and
the weak infrared range. I did not find any of these problems with the
U2 and I recommend getting the U2 instead of the U1.</p></li>
</ul>
