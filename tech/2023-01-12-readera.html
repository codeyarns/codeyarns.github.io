<p>In my never-ending quest for the perfect ebook reading app on
Android, I discovered <a
href="https://readera.org/en/book-reader"><strong>ReadEra</strong></a>.
My gold standard for an ebook app is to match all the features that are
available while reading ebooks on the <a
href="2022-02-10-kobo-nia.html"><strong>Kobo</strong></a>. And I think
this Android app is the first one that fulfilled that criteria.</p>
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Install:</strong> Installing the free app is
straightforward from the Play Store <a
href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.readera&amp;hl=en">here</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Formats:</strong> By default it scans all the EPUB, PDF,
DJVU and other ebook formats on the device and displays them under the
<strong>Books &amp; documents</strong> section.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Collections:</strong> A book can be marked as favorite
(⭐), to read (🕑) , have read (✔) or trashed, and it will appear in
those collections, accessible from the top-left menu. It can also be
added to your own custom named collection.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reading:</strong> This app had the best book reading
features I’ve seen: full screen, bookmarking of pages, table of contents
navigation, all kinds of font/text formatting/colors and
section-specific progress indicators.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fonts:</strong> The app allows choosing among many of its
fonts, the fonts on the phone or fonts you can download and
add.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Progress:</strong> My current progress in the book is
shown through a neat progress bar at the bottom. My progress in the
current section/chapter and the title of the current section/chapter is
displayed at the top. TOC of the book and jumping through the TOC can be
done by clicking the top-right TOC button. All of this can be made to
disappear when in full screen mode for full focus.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Text selection:</strong> The context menu when text is
selected allows so many useful operations: copy, quote, dictionary,
translate, note, share and web search. The context menu also has
settings where I can customize which dictionary app (I use WordWeb for
this), translator app (I installed Google Translate for this) and
browser (for search) should be used. Also, the context menu can be
simple (show only copy and quote) or advanced (all options are shown) -
this is useful for me to do dictionary lookups in a single
click.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Filesystem as store:</strong> This app does not add books
to some store of its own. All my ebook files exist on the Android
filesystem as before.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="premium">Premium</h2>
<p>This is one of the few apps that brings me great joy and great value
in the many hours I spend in it every week. So not surprisingly I was
more than happy to pay for <a
href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.readera.premium"><strong>ReadEra
Premium</strong></a>, the premium version of the app to support the
makers of this app (cost $10.99 in May 2023). Note that you just pay
once and can install the app on all devices that have your same Google
account.</p>
<p>Some of the features I liked in the Premium version:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>File sync:</strong> Synchronize all the ebook files
between all the devices where you have ReadEra Premium installed. I have
set this to sync only on wifi. I cannot believe how I lived without this
since now I can pick up my phone or my tablet and continue reading
without having to recall if the book or the page is synced on that
device.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sync settings using Google Drive:</strong> If you link a
common Google account to the Premium app on all your devices, it can
sync up the quotes, dictionary words and other settings between all the
devices using Google Drive.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dictionary:</strong> Any word I lookup in dictionary is
kept underlined in that ebook. Futhermore, all the words I looked up are
stored in the app’s Dictionary section for revision. This is also synced
between devices if the sync is setup.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tried with:</strong> ReadEra 22.12.12+1720</p>
