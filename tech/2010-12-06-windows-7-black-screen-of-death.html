<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
<p>I started to see a variant of the infamous <strong>Black Screen of Death (BSoD)</strong> on my <strong>Windows 7</strong> computer a couple of months ago. The computer would be running all day, no shutdown or standby or hibernation. I lock the computer when I leave the desk. When I came back to use the computer in the morning or after lunch or after a weekend, the Windows 7 login screen would be displayed correctly. I login successfully and the screen would go completely black! I could still see the mouse cursor appear and disappear if I moved it.</p>
<p>This problem would occur about 1 in 5 times I logged in like this. I was left with no option but to restart the computer, and it would login fine after that.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>Thankfully, I found that I was <a href="http://superuser.com/questions/119276">not the only person</a> facing this problem. This was not the actual BSoD since it was certainly not any driver or kernel failure. The popular suggestions given on the Internet to solve this were:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Update graphics card drivers.</p></li>
<li><p>Update or uninstall all virtual display or multiple display software.</p></li>
<li><p>Update or uninstall all time tracking software.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I updated the drivers for my NVIDIA GeForce 9800 GT card, but the BSoD still happened a while after that.</p>
<p>I uninstalled <a href="http://www.dexpot.de/"><strong>Dexpot</strong></a>, the virtual desktop manager I was using. It has been a few weeks now and the BSoD has not happened after this! :-) I am guessing Dexpot was doing something when I logged back in which caused a black screen. If you are facing such a BSoD, you may want to try uninstalling your virtual desktop software and see if it solves the problem.</p>
