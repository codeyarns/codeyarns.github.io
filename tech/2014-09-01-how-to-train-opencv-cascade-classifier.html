<p>OpenCV ships with an application that can be used to train a <strong>cascade classifier</strong>. The steps to prepare your data and train the classifier can be quite elaborate. I have detailed the steps that I used below to train the classifier to identify an object (say car):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Two OpenCV programs: <code>opencv_createsamples</code> and <code>opencv_traincascade</code> will be used for this process. They should be installed along with your OpenCV. You can also compile them while compiling OpenCV from source. Make sure to enable the option <code>BUILD_APPS</code> in the CMake GUI. This is the option that builds these applications.</p></li>
<li><p>Prepare images that have one or more instances of the object of interest. These will be used to generate <strong>positive</strong> samples later. Also, prepare images that do not have the object of interest. These will be used to generate <strong>negative</strong> samples later.</p></li>
<li><p>It is mandatory to use <code>opencv_createsamples</code> to generate the positive samples for <code>opencv_traincascade</code>. The output of this program is a <code>.vec</code> file that is used as input to <code>opencv_traincascade</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>If you have image patches of the object and need to generate positive sample images by applying transformations (rotations) on this in 3 dimensions and then superimposing it on a background, you can do that using <code>opencv_createsamples</code>. See its <a href="http://docs.opencv.org/doc/user_guide/ug_traincascade.html">documentation</a> for details.</p></li>
<li><p>In my case, I already had one or more instances of the object captured with its actual background. So, what I instead had to do was to indicate the patch rectangles in each image where my object was located. You can do this by hand or by writing a simple OpenCV program to display image to you and you mark out the rectangles on the objects and stores these values in a text file. The format of this text file required by <code>opencv_createsamples</code> can be seen in its <a href="http://docs.opencv.org/doc/user_guide/ug_traincascade.html">documentation</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>To create the positive samples file, I invoked <code>opencv_createsamples</code> as:</p></li>
</ul>
<pre><code>$ opencv_createsamples -info obj-rects.txt -w 50 -h 50 -vec pos-samples.vec</code></pre>
<p>Here, <code>obj-rects.txt</code> is a text file that has the information of the rectangles where the object is located in each image. See step above for details. The output of this program is stored in <code>pos-samples.vec</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>To view the positive samples that have been created by this program:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>$ opencv_createsamples -vec pos-samples.vec -w 50 -h 50</code></pre>
<p>Note that it switches to viewing mode when you only provide these three parameters and their values should match what you provided to create the positive samples.</p>
<ul>
<li>Now we can train the cascade classifier. The details of its parameters can be seen in its documentation. I used this invocation:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>$ opencv_traincascade -data obj-classifier -vec pos-samples.vec -bg neg-filepaths.txt -precalcValBufSize 2048 -precalcIdxBufSize 2048 -numPos 200 -numNeg 2000 -nstages 20 -minhitrate 0.999 -maxfalsealarm 0.5 -w 50 -h 50 -nonsym -baseFormatSave</code></pre>
<p><code>obj-classifier</code> is a directory where we are asking the classifier files to be stored. Note that this directory should already be created by you. <code>pos-samples.vec</code> is the file we generated in step above. <code>neg-filepaths.txt</code> is a file with list of paths to negative sample files. <code>2048</code> is the amount of MB of memory we are requesting the program to use. The more the memory, the faster the training. <code>200</code> is the number of positive samples in <code>pos-samples.vec</code>. This number is also reported by <code>opencv_createsamples</code> when it finishes its execution. <code>2000</code> is the number of negative sample image paths we have specified in <code>neg-filepaths.txt</code>. <code>20</code> is the number of stages in the classifier we wish. <code>50x50</code> is the size of object in these images. This should be same as what was specified with <code>opencv_createsamples</code>. <code>0.999</code> and <code>0.5</code> are self-explanatory. Details on all these parameters are found in the <a href="http://docs.opencv.org/doc/user_guide/ug_traincascade.html">documentation</a>.</p>
