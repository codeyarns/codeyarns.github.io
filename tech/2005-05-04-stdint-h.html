<p>A colleague informed me today that my name had appeared in the <a href="http://www.embedded.com/2005/0504/">April 2005 issue</a> of the <em><a href="http://www.embedded.com/mag.htm">Embedded Systems Programming</a></em> magazine. Back in December 2004, I had commented to Dan Saks about his article <em><a href="http://www.embedded.com/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=55301821">More ways to map memory</a></em> on the usage of the available C fixed width integer types. We had an email discussion on it and I forgot all about it. I had blogged earlier about these types.</p>
<p>In his latest article <em><a href="http://embedded.com/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=160502362">Sizing and aligning device registers</a></em> he mentions that email conversation. I know this is not anything significant, but this is the first time my name has appeared in a deadwood tech magazine! :-)</p>

<p>Ashwin N (ashwin.n@gmail.com) suggested yet another way to define the special_register type:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If you want to use an unsigned four-byte word, shouldn't you be doing:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>#include
/* ... */
typedef uint32_t volatile special_register;</code></pre>
This should work with all modern standard C compilers/libraries.
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The typedef <code>uint32_t</code> is an alias for some unsigned integer type that occupies exactly 32 bits. It's one of many possible exact-width unsigned integer types with names of the form <code>uintN_t</code>, where <code>N</code> is a decimal integer representing the number of bits the type occupies. Other common exact-width unsigned types are <code>uint8_t</code> and <code>uint16_t</code>. For each type <code>uintN_t</code>, there's a corresponding type <code>intN_t</code> for a signed integer that occupies exactly <code>N</code> bits and has two's complement representation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have been reluctant to use <code>&lt;stdint.h&gt;</code>. It's available in C99, but not in earlier C dialects nor in Standard C++. However, it's becoming increasingly available in C++ compilers, and likely to make it into the C++ Standard someday. Moreover, as Michael Barr observed, if the header isn't available with your compiler, you can implement it yourself without much fuss. I plan to start using these types more in my work.</p>
Again, using a typedef such as <code>special_register</code> makes the exact choice of the integer type much less important. However, I'm starting to think that <code>uint32_t</code> is the best type to use in defining the special_register type.
