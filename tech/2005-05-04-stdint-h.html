<p>A colleague informed me today that my name had appeared in the April
2005 issue of the <a href="http://www.embedded.com/">Embedded Systems
Programming</a> magazine. Back in December 2004, I had commented to Dan
Saks about his article <a
href="http://www.embedded.com/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=55301821">More
ways to map memory</a> on the usage of the available C fixed width
integer types. We had an email discussion on it and I forgot all about
it. I had blogged earlier about these types.</p>
<p>In his latest article <a
href="https://www.embedded.com/sizing-and-aligning-device-registers/">Sizing
and aligning device registers</a> he mentions that email conversation. I
know this is not anything significant, but this is the first time my
name has appeared in a deadwood tech magazine! 😊</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ashwin N (<a href="mailto:ashwin.n@gmail.com"
class="email">ashwin.n@gmail.com</a>) suggested yet another way to
define the special_register type:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If you want to use an unsigned four-byte word, shouldn’t you be
doing:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>#include
/* ... */
typedef uint32_t volatile special_register;</code></pre>
This should work with all modern standard C compilers/libraries.
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The typedef <code>uint32_t</code> is an alias for some unsigned
integer type that occupies exactly 32 bits. It’s one of many possible
exact-width unsigned integer types with names of the form
<code>uintN_t</code>, where <code>N</code> is a decimal integer
representing the number of bits the type occupies. Other common
exact-width unsigned types are <code>uint8_t</code> and
<code>uint16_t</code>. For each type <code>uintN_t</code>, there’s a
corresponding type <code>intN_t</code> for a signed integer that
occupies exactly <code>N</code> bits and has two’s complement
representation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have been reluctant to use <code>&lt;stdint.h&gt;</code>. It’s
available in C99, but not in earlier C dialects nor in Standard C++.
However, it’s becoming increasingly available in C++ compilers, and
likely to make it into the C++ Standard someday. Moreover, as Michael
Barr observed, if the header isn’t available with your compiler, you can
implement it yourself without much fuss. I plan to start using these
types more in my work.</p>
Again, using a typedef such as <code>special_register</code> makes the
exact choice of the integer type much less important. However, I’m
starting to think that <code>uint32_t</code> is the best type to use in
defining the special_register type.
