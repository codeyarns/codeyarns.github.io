<p>I am happy to see that this blog has crossed <strong>2 million views</strong> today! It crossed 1 million just <a href="/2013/12/20/1-million/">about an year ago</a>.</p>
<p>Starting from around June this year, I noticed that there was a substantial increase in traffic. Something clicked in the blog's favour inside Google's search engine? Anyway, it is now getting about 100,000 views a month. People from 231 countries have viewed these entries, including from North Korea.</p>
<p>This blog is just a notebook for me to jot down configurations and settings for esoteric setups and errors that I encounter at work and home. In that aspect, it has remained immensely useful. I rely on it now more than ever as I get through the day.</p>
<p>Let us see if this blog can hit 3 million view next year or if Google changes its mind :-)</p>
