<p><strong>XBMC</strong>, and hence <strong>Raspbmc</strong>, can automatically show <strong>subtitles</strong> when the subtitles file has the same name as the video filename and is placed in the same directory. What is awesome is that you can download and play subtitles for any video file right from the comfort of your XBMC!</p>
<p><strong>XBMC 13 (Gotham) and later</strong></p>
<p>XBMC 13 added native support for subtitle downloading. Go to Settings &gt; Video &gt; Subtitles. Scroll down to Default TV service and Default Movie service. When you enter, you are given a list of subtitle websites and you can pick which you want for TV and movies. More details can be found <a href="http://wiki.xbmc.org/index.php?title=HOW-TO:Setup_subtitle_services">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>XBMC 12.x and older</strong></p>
<p>First, you need to install the <strong>XBMC Subtitles</strong> add-on. To do this, go toÂ System &gt; Settings &gt; Add-ons &gt; Get Add-ons &gt; XBMC.org Add-ons &gt; Subtitles, choose XBMC Subtitles Add-on and install it.</p>
<p><strong>Downloading subtitles</strong></p>
<p>Next, play any video file. While it is playing choose the <strong>Download Subtitles</strong> option. This is available in XBMC remote apps like <a href="2013/01/20/yatse-on-android-as-remote-for-raspbmc/"><strong>Yatse</strong></a>. Else, choose whatever option makes the video playback scroller appear. There on the set of icons below it on the right side, pick the first one.</p>
<p>Either way, this takes you to the Downloading Subtitles widget. XBMC will query subtitles databases online and show you a list of the best matching subtitles for your video file. Pick the one you want and press OK. XBMC will download the subtitle file and restore playback of the video file with the subtitles enabled. It is as easy as that! :-)</p>
