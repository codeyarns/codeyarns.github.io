<p><strong>Microsoft Whiteboard</strong> is a virtual whiteboard that is
available as a Windows app that can be installed from the Windows Store.
The whiteboard can also be used from a browser by visiting <a
href="https://whiteboard.microsoft.com/">whiteboard.microsoft.com</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Both the app and the website require you to have a <strong>Microsoft
online account</strong> of some sort: on Live, Outlook or your company’s
Microsoft account.</li>
<li>The <strong>whiteboard files</strong> are not stored locally, but to
your Microsoft online account. So they are accessible from both the app
and the website. There is no way to get access to the actual whiteboard
files or understand its file format.</li>
<li>The website has a limited subset of the features available in the
app. I found drawing in the browser to have a much higher latency
compared to the app. Due to these reasons, I would <strong>recommend
using the app</strong> at all times and only use the website when you
have no choice.</li>
<li>When you open the app, you are in the <strong>My
whiteboards</strong> section. Here you can create a new whiteboard or
open existing whiteboards.</li>
<li>In the My Whiteboards section, you can click on the
<strong>…</strong> on a whiteboard to give it a name, share it with
others, export it or delete it.</li>
<li>One of the main features of this app is <strong>online
collaboration</strong>: you can invite others to draw on the whiteboard
with you.</li>
<li>Whiteboards can be <strong>exported</strong> to a PNG file (bitmap
format) or a SVG file (vector format).</li>
<li>The website offers 4 markers with black, red, green and blue colors
and an eraser. The marker tip width is fixed and so are the colors.
There are no other features in the webiste.</li>
<li>The app has 6 <strong>marker</strong> pens. Each can be set to a
color from the pre-selected palette of 16 colors. No other custom colors
can be chosen. There are 4 thicknesses for the marker tip.</li>
<li>The app has a <strong>highlighter</strong> with 16 pre-selected
colors and 4 tip thicknesses.</li>
<li>Other tools in the app include an eraser, a fantastic
<strong>ruler</strong> (you need to use the mouse scrollwheel to rotate
it), lasso (to select objects for cut-copy-paste) and insertion of image
files and other files.</li>
<li>No idea what the <strong>Active pen</strong> feature does.</li>
<li>The <strong>Ink to Shape</strong> feature is awesome. It turns
triangles, rectangles, circles and other shapes you draw into a nicer
uniform shape.</li>
<li>The <strong>Ink to Table</strong> feature makes a spreadsheet-like
table when you start dividing a square or rectangle into rows or columns
with your drawing strokes.</li>
<li>The <strong>Object Snapping</strong> feature does what it says.</li>
<li>The <strong>Format Background</strong> allows you set the background
color from 10 colors and choose a <strong>grid</strong> from several
grid types: solid, dot, square, graph, hybrid, diamond, triangle, wide
rule and narrow rule.</li>
</ul>
<p>To be honest the app (not the website) has enough features to be
suitable as a great sketching tool for software engineers. Missing
features include choosing custom colors and layers.</p>
