<p>The first edition of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compilers:_Principles,_Techniques,_and_Tools"><strong>Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools</strong></a> textbook is popularly known as the <strong>red dragon book</strong>. This was the compilers textbook I had back in my undergrad. Though this book by Aho, Sethi and Ullman is famous, I do not particularly remember enjoying studying this book in my undergrad. I recently decided to go back and give it another try. Though a second edition was released in 2006, known as the <strong>purple dragon book</strong>, I decided to stick to the 1986 first edition. At 700+ pages, this book took me a few weeks just to quickly browse through and study whatever I found interesting.</p>
<p>Some of the topics the book covers include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Lexical analysis: Conversion of source code into tokens. NFA, DFA and how to convert NFA to DFA. Regular expressions and how to match regex using NFA or DFA.</p></li>
<li><p>Syntax analysis: CFG and tree constructs to parse tokens from the lexical analyzer.</p></li>
<li><p>Call stacks, caller and calle calling conventions. Stack and heap allocation methods. Call by value, call by reference and other ways of passing inputs to methods. Symbol tables.</p></li>
<li><p>Code generation: 3-address code as intermediate language. Basic blocks and basic block optimizations. Peephole optimizations and register allocation methods.</p></li>
<li><p>Code optimization: Loop optimization, code motion, induction variable elimination, reduction in strength.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There is a lot more in the book, but I either skipped over it because I was not interested or just found it difficult to learn. A big problem with this book is that it is theoretical, every chapter feels exactly like reading a survey paper in the field of compilers. All possible methods and data structures are presented, making this not a suitable book for instruction.</p>
<p>What I liked about the book is that it has lots of illustrative examples and lots of figures. It talks about lots of old-timey languages like C, Fortran, and Pascal and old computers, and brings in a lot of language and compiler history. I always relish knowing the history and context in which new inventions were made.</p>
<p>In the final conclusion, I must say that despite all the juicy details of old languages, OSes, tools and computers, the book is still weighed down by not having a clear instructive direction and by its focus on theory.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 3/4</p>
