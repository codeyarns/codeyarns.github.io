<p><a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/headsets/zone-wireless-bluetooth.html"><strong>Logitech Zone Wireless</strong></a> is a wireless on-ear headset made by Logitech, primarily designed for work. I got the <strong>Microsoft Teams</strong> variant of the headset, which has features that integrate it closer with the Teams app.</p>
<ul>
<li>The headset comes with its own <strong>USB-A receiver</strong>. This is just great since I do not need to bother with Bluetooth pairing. I just turn on the headset and it instantly is connected to my computer. Neither do I need to worry that my computer might not have a Bluetooth receiver with the latest profile, everything just works.</li>
<li>The headset has a <strong>boom mic</strong>, which can be flipped down to my mouth or flipped back to rest on the headset. In Microsoft Teams, this flipping automatically unmutes or mutes the mic. I find this super convenient in work meetings.</li>
<li>With a kid and a baby in our home, having a boom mic was important for me. The boom mic mostly eliminates all the background noise when I am speaking so my audience only hears a clear voice. When combined with the <strong>noise suppression</strong> in Microsoft Teams, this works to eliminate most of the noise. The boom is short, I think a longer boom (like in my simple Logitech H390 USB headset) would have further reduced the background noise and isolated my voice.</li>
<li>The audio quality in the <strong>speakers</strong> is fine for work calls and passable for music. If you want to enjoy your music, this is definitely <em>not</em> enough.</li>
<li>This headset is on-ear, so the cups rest <em>on</em> the ears. This was super uncomfortable for me, after being spoilt by the luxurious comfort of my <a href="2020-03-16-bose-ae2-soundlink.html">Bose Soundlink AE2 headphones</a>. Also, not sure what materials they use for the cups because it made my ears super hot. The solution that partly fixed these problems was to wear the headset a little lower - so my ears got to breathe and also the headset was no longer snug.</li>
<li>The headset barely sits on my ears - any heavy shaking of my head and unseat them. You can forget about wearing this for a brisk walk or a gentle jog - out of the question.</li>
<li>The <strong>buttons</strong> on this headset are the worst I have ever used. The biggest culprit is the power button - it can barely be found with my fingers (while I am wearing the headset) and has the worst action I have ever seen in a button! It takes like 2-3 presses for me to finally power on or power off this headset.</li>
<li>The build quality is passable, strictly made for work and not comfort. The metal parts feel harshly hard (why use metal?) and the softer parts feel cheap.</li>
<li>By installing the <strong>LogiTune</strong> application, I am able to see the battery level of the headset, configure the voice prompts and configure what the various buttons do.</li>
</ul>
