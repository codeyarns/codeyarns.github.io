href="https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/headsets/zone-wireless-bluetooth.html"><strong>Logitech
Zone Wireless</strong></a> is a wireless on-ear headset made by
Logitech, primarily designed for work. I got the <strong>Microsoft
Teams</strong> variant of the headset, which has features that integrate
it closer with the Teams app.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This is a <strong>wireless</strong> headset - which can be mighty
useful when working from home and attending meetings. For example, you
can walk around and think or talk, grab water or coffee from the
kitchen, use the bathroom or open the door to someone, all while being
in a call.</p></li>
<li><p>The headset comes with its own USB Type-A <strong>wireless
receiver</strong> dongle. This eliminates the bother of Bluetooth
pairing. I just turn on the headset and it instantly is connected to my
computer. Neither do I need to worry that my computer might not have a
Bluetooth receiver with the latest profile - everything just
works.</p></li>
<li><p>However, if you prefer <strong>Bluetooth</strong> since it avoids
having to use a separate dongle, that is supported too. Put the headset
into <strong>pairing</strong> mode by first turning it on (steady white
light) and hold-press again (blinking white light). It should appear as
<em>Zone Wireless</em> in the Bluetooth device list.</p></li>
<li><p>This headset can be paired with up to 8 devices. And it can be
actively connected to 2 of those devices at the same time. I find this
very useful to have it connected to both my work laptop and my home
computer at the same time when working from home.</p></li>
<li><p>The headset has a <strong>boom mic</strong>, which can be flipped
down to my mouth or flipped back to rest on the headset. In Microsoft
Teams, this flipping automatically unmutes or mutes the mic. I find this
super convenient in work meetings.</p></li>
<li><p>With a kid and a baby in our home, having a boom mic was
important for me. The boom mic mostly eliminates all the background
noise when I am speaking so my audience only hears a clear voice. When
combined with the <strong>noise suppression</strong> in Microsoft Teams,
this works to eliminate most of the noise. The boom is short, I think a
longer boom (like in my simple Logitech H390 USB headset) would have
further reduced the background noise and isolated my voice.</p></li>
<li><p>The audio quality in the <strong>speakers</strong> is fine for
work calls and passable for music. If you want to enjoy your music, this
is definitely <em>not</em> enough.</p></li>
<li><p>These are <strong>on-ear headphones</strong>, so the cups rest
<em>on</em> the ears. This was super uncomfortable for me, after being
spoilt by the luxurious comfort of my <a
href="2020-03-16-bose-ae2-soundlink.html">Bose Soundlink AE2
headphones</a>. Also, not sure what materials they use for the cups
because it made my ears super hot. The solution that partly fixed these
problems was to wear the headset a little loose/lower - so my ears got
to breathe and also the headset was no longer snug.</p></li>
<li><p>The headset barely sits on my ears - any heavy shaking of my head
and unseat them. I cannot use them to do any sort of exercise (pushups
or squats) while participating in a meeting.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>buttons</strong> on this headset are the worst I have
ever used. The biggest culprit is the power button - it can barely be
found with my fingers (while I am wearing the headset) and has the worst
action I have ever seen in a button! It takes like 2-3 presses for me to
finally power on or power off this headset.</p></li>
<li><p>The build quality is passable, strictly made for work and not
comfort. The metal parts feel harshly hard (why use metal?) and the
softer parts feel cheap.</p></li>
<li><p>It came with a long <strong>USB Type-A to Type-C cable</strong>.
When the headset’s battery is low and I still need to attend meetings, I
find it useful to continue to charge the headset with this cable while I
am taking calls. Sadly, the headset still needs to be turned on and
connected in the wireless mode to use like this - it does <em>not</em>
appear as a <em>wired</em> headset over USB.</p></li>
<li><p>By installing the <strong>LogiTune</strong> application, I am
able to see the battery level of the headset, configure the voice
prompts and configure what the center button does (on press, double
press and long press). The <strong>voice prompts</strong> provide audio
prompts in your chosen language when you try to pair, rotate mic to on
or off (“mute on” or “mute off”). I keep this feature OFF since I prefer
the different kinds of beeps it uses instead. Even with voice prompts
OFF, it uses voice prompts for “power on” and “power off” which I
actually found to be a well-thought idea. The app has a noise supression
option, which I do not turn on because it adds a very audible low
background hiss which sounds terrible (and it is on even when the mic is
off).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>After using this for many months, I believe that a wireless headset
with boom mic and its own receiver dongle is super useful for working
from home. This headset in particular is pretty average and you could go
for something more comfortable and with better buttons.</p>
