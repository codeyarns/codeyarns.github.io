<h1 class="title">AMD EPYC 7002 Processors</h1>

<p>This is a summary of my understanding of the <strong>AMD EPYC 7002</strong> processors, and more specifically the <strong>AMD EPYC 7742</strong> processor:</p>
<h2 id="name">Name</h2>
<p>Chip names always puzzle me, so let us decipher this AMD naming first:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>EPYC</em> is the current name for AMD‚Äôs server processor line - essentially processors that go into local or cloud rack servers. <em>Ryzen</em> is the current name for their desktop and mobile processors.</p></li>
<li><p><em>7002</em> or <em>7XX2</em>: 7 is the series number, 2 is the generation (because these use Zen2 microarchitecture). The generation 2 chips are also called the <em>Rome</em> generation. The 2 XX digits in the middle represent performance, higher the better. They can range 25-74, so <em>7742</em> is the most performant processor.</p></li>
<li><p>All these processors are designed for dual-socket use - that is, 2 of these processors in a server which is the common rack server scenario. The processors designed for single-socket use will have a P suffix: 7742P for example.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="chiplets">Chiplets</h2>
<ul>
<li>The CPU is actually a <strong>MCM</strong> (Multi-Chip Module) of 9 different chips (called <em>chiplets</em>) on a board.</li>
<li>8 of the chiplets are each called <strong>CCD</strong> (Core Complex Die) and the chiplet in the center is called the <strong>IOD</strong> (I/O Die).</li>
<li>CCD are made from a 7nm process and IOD is made from a 14nm process.</li>
<li>Each CCD is composed of 2 <strong>CCX</strong> (Core CompleX).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ccx">CCX</h2>
<ul>
<li>Each CCX has 4 Zen2 cores and 16MB of L3 cache shared between the 4 cores.</li>
<li>Each Zen2 core has 32KB 8-way L1 I-cache, 32KB 8-way L1 D-cache and 512KB 8-way L2 cache.</li>
<li>Each Zen2 core does hyper-threading, supporting <strong>SMT</strong> (Simultaneous Multi-Threading) as 2 cores.</li>
<li>All inter-CCX communication, inside a CCD or in between CCD, all have to go through the IOD.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="iod">IOD</h2>
<ul>
<li>IOD handles all the communication with memory, other devices and with the other CPU (in dual-socket configuration).</li>
<li>CCDs talk to the IOD through the <strong>IF</strong> (Infinity Fabric) interconnect.</li>
<li>The IOD also has DDR memory channels to talk to RAM and PCIe connections to talk to GPUs, CPUs and other devices.</li>
<li>Up to 4TB of memory is supported per socket.</li>
<li>Set Maximum Bus Frequency to 2667 MT/s for optimum memory access latency.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="memory-channels">Memory channels</h2>
<ul>
<li>The IOD of each CPU supports 8 memory channels. The 8 memory channels are named ABCDEFGH.</li>
<li>Each memory channel supports up to 2 DIMMs. The 2 DIMMs are connected serially on the channel like this: <code>Channel G -- DIMM 1 -- DIMM 2</code>. A CPU supports 16 DIMMs and so a dual-socket server supports up to 32 DIMMs.</li>
<li>For optimum performance, AMD recommends that all channels should be populated and with equal capacity. So, on a dual-socket server it is recommended to have all 32 DIMMs filled up or 16 DIMMs filled up (with one DIMM per channel).</li>
<li>When there is 1 DIMM per channel, the system is said to be in <strong>1 DPC</strong> mode. This is the most performant configuration.</li>
<li>When there are 2 DIMMs per channel, the system is said to be in <strong>2 DPC</strong> mode. This configuration runs at lesser memory speed than 1 DPC.</li>
<li>All other configurations (12 DIMMs for example) are suboptimal compared to 1 DPC or 2 DPC.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="pcie">PCIe</h2>
<ul>
<li>These CPUs support PCIe 4.0. x16 (16 lanes) provide 32 GB/s of bandwidth in bidirectional use and 16 GB/s in one direction.</li>
<li>The IOD of each CPU supports 8 of these x16 PCIe channels. That is 128 lanes in total, for a total of 256 GB/s of bidirectional and 128 GB/s of unidirectional bandwidth.</li>
<li>4 of the x16 channels are used to talk to the other socket in a dual-socket configuration.</li>
<li>For optimum performance, pin workloads to the socket that is directly connected to the GPU or NIC the workload uses.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="numa">NUMA</h2>
<ul>
<li>NUMA is configured by setting the <strong>NPS</strong> (NUMA Nodes Per Socket) value in BIOS. Possible values are 0-4.</li>
<li><code>NPS=0</code>: Entire 2-socket system is 1 NUMA node. 16-channel interleaving is used for memory.</li>
<li><code>NPS=1</code>: Each socket is 1 NUMA node. 8-channel interleaving for memory.</li>
<li><code>NPS=2</code>: Each socket is 2 NUMA nodes. 4-channel interleaving for memory.</li>
<li><code>NPS=4</code>: Each socket is 4 NUMA nodes. 2-channel interleaving for memory.</li>
</ul>
