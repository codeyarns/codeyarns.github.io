<p><strong>Mercurial</strong> users keep insisting that you do not really need to create actual branches to work. But, if you are one of the few who likes to do this, <strong>merging branches</strong> is just as easy too. I use <a href="http://tortoisehg.bitbucket.org/"><strong>TortoiseHg</strong></a>, but the equivalent command-line options are just as obvious.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Consider branches A and B. You wish to merge B to A, so that work on A can continue. Typically, A might be the <strong>default branch</strong> and B can be a <strong>feature branch</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Finish, test and commit all the files on both branches A and B.</p></li>
<li><p>Open <strong>Repository Explorer</strong>. <strong>Update</strong> the working directory to branch A. This can be done by choosing the head of branch A, right-click and choose <em>Update</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Choose the head of branch B, right-click and choose <em>Merge with</em>. Tip of branch A will automatically be chosen as the target for the merge. Click <em>Merge</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Mercurial will try to merge the files automatically as much as possible. For the files with merge conflicts, it will pop up <a href="http://kdiff3.sourceforge.net/"><strong>KDiff3</strong></a> windows so you can pick the changes you want merged. The conflict windows are displayed sequentially, finish one and the next one is displayed.</p></li>
<li><p>Settle all the conflicts and your merge is done! Branch B should be connected to branch A nicely in the graph displayed in Repository Explorer now.</p></li>
</ol>
