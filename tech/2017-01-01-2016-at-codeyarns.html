<p>Yet another year has passed by! 2016 was a huge year in my personal life and so I could not write as many posts as I wanted to here on my blog. Also, keeping a <a href="https://twitter.com/daariga">Twitter account</a> is well known to cut down on your energy to write blog posts. Here are some stats from the year for <strong>CodeYarns</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="2017-01-01-2016-at-codeyarns/20170103_stats.html"><img src="https://codeyarns.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/20170103_stats.png" alt="20170103_stats" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Posts:</strong> I wrote 165 posts for the blog this year. This is a big drop from 2015, when I wrote 389 posts.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Views:</strong> The blog saw more than 1 million views this year, which is a bit less than last year. I attribute this to the change in the name (from <strong>ChooruCode</strong>) and the corresponding change in the domain name. The views came from 830K visitors, for a views per visitor ratio of 1.26. This ratio has also been reducing over the years, which is a general trend for blogs as far as I know.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="2017-01-01-2016-at-codeyarns/20170105_map.html"><img src="https://codeyarns.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/20170105_map.png" alt="20170105_map" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Countries:</strong> The top 3 nations of visitors continue to be USA, India and Germany. There is a long tail of nations, including 14 views from North Korea! The blog saw visitors from a total of 221 countries, which is almost all of them. The only nations which were missing in the above map seemed to me as Chad and Central African Republic.</li>
</ul>
<p>For 2017, I hope to write an average of one post per day. Got to see if I can manage that! :-)</p>
