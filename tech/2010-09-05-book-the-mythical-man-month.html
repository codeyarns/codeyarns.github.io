<p>A staggering 35 years after it was first published <strong>The Mythical Man-Month: Essays in Software Engineering</strong> by Frederick R. Brooks Jr. remains the most important book a software engineer should read. I had been putting off reading the book for many years and finally gave in since it was one of the texts for the Software Engineering course I am teaching at university. My full review of the book can be found <a href="http://fishmoth.wordpress.com/2010/09/05/the-mythical-man-month-essays-on-software-engineering/">here</a>.</p>
