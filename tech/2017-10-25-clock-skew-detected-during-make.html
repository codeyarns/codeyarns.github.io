<h1 id="problem">Problem</h1>
<p>I was trying to build source files on a remote server using <strong>make</strong>. The make command would sometimes throw up a <strong>clock skew</strong> warning like this:</p>
<pre><code>make[2]: Warning: File `foobar.cpp&#39; has modification time 36 s in the future
make[2]: warning:  Clock skew detected.  Your build may be incomplete</code></pre>
<h1 id="solution">Solution</h1>
<p>It turns out that these source files were actually shared from another computer to this remote server using <strong>NFS</strong>. Using the <strong>date</strong> command at the local computer and the remote server, I found that there was a difference of a few seconds between the two.</p>
<p>More investigation showed that only the local computer was using <strong>NTP</strong> and so its time was correct. The remote server was not using NTP and so its time was wrong.</p>
<p>To install and enable NTP on the remote server, I used these commands:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo apt install ntp
$ sudo service ntp reload</code></pre>
<p>Note that it takes a few minutes for the synchronized correct time to show up on the computer after these commands. After the sync, I no longer get the clock skew warnings from make.</p>
