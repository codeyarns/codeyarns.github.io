<p>I recently <a href="http://codeyarns.wordpress.com/2012/02/16/extra-buttons/">wrote</a> about the <strong>eXtra Buttons</strong> utility that can be used to keep on top, minimize to tray and apply other tricks on any window. But, if you use <strong><a href="http://codeyarns.wordpress.com/2011/05/16/dexpot/">Dexpot</a></strong> as your virtual desktop manager, it turns out that it can do all these tricks in its recent version.</p>
<p>To apply any of these tricks, just right-click on the window titlebar, choose Dexpot and the trick you want.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The one that I almost use all the time is <strong>Always on top</strong>. This is very useful to keep a VLC window playing videos or some text file in the right bottom while working on other windows.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Minimize to tray</strong> is useful when I want an application running in the background, but not have it grab any of the real estate on the taskbar.This means that I can instantly add the minimize to tray functionality to any application that does not have it built in.</p></li>
<li><p>Roll up, maximize horizontally and vertically are not very useful to me.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>transparency</strong> trick is sometimes useful to keep a PowerShell window on the top, while not losing sight of the windows underneath.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tried with:</strong> Dexpot 1.5.10</p>
