<h1 class="title">Beelink SER5 Mini PC</h1>

<p>The <a href="https://www.bee-link.com/"><strong>Beelink
SER5</strong></a> is a popular series of mini PC that I recently
acquired to use as a home PC.</p>
<h2 id="specifications">Specifications</h2>
<ul>
<li>CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 5500U (6 cores, 12 threads)</li>
<li>GPU: AMD Lucienne</li>
<li>RAM: 16GB DDR4</li>
<li>Motherboard: AZE SER v1.0</li>
<li>BIOS: American Megatrends LLC. vFP655U508</li>
<li>SSD: 500GB NVME</li>
<li>LAN: Realtek RTL8111/8168/8411 PCIe Gigabit Ethernet</li>
<li>USB: Realtek RTL8153 Gigabit Ethernet Adapter</li>
<li>Wifi/Bluetooth: Intel AX200</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="boot-keys">Boot keys</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>F7</code>: Get boot menu</li>
<li><code>Del</code>: Get into BIOS</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="first-steps">First steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Note that the board inside the mini PC was not really screwed in.
Thankfully, I had to open it up to add a harddisk (see below) and I
noticed that the 4 screws were not really holding the motherboard in
place. Shaking the box a bit dislodged all of them and I promptly
screwed them back in.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="dual-booting-with-linux">Dual booting with Linux</h2>
<p>This was pretty straightforward except for some problems I faced
since I had added an extra hard disk that used to be a bootable Linux OS
earlier.</p>
<p>Here is what worked:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a Linux installer USB flash drive as described <a
href="2013-03-17-how-to-create-a-ubuntu-installer-usb-flash-drive-on-windows.html">here</a>.</li>
<li>Restart the mini PC, choose <code>F7</code> to get the boot menu and
choose to boot from the flash drive.</li>
<li>Install Ubuntu. Either choose the <em>alongside the Windows boot
manager</em> option or you can create an ext4 <code>/</code> partition
and use that. Remove the flash drive and reboot.</li>
<li>To my surprise, even after installing Ubuntu, there was no Grub boot
menu and the system booted into Windows directly. After a lot of
frustrations and reinstalls, I finally figured out that I needed to get
into the BIOS and place the <em>Ubuntu</em> option higher than the
<em>Windows boot manager</em> option in <strong>UEFI Boot</strong>
priorities.</li>
<li>After that, I was able to see the Grub menu on restart and boot into
Linux.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="installing-hard-disk">Installing hard disk</h2>
<p>There is dedicated space underneath the bottom cover for installing
an extra harddisk. Here is what I had to do to install a 1TB harddisk to
the Beelink:</p>
<ul>
<li>Power off the Beelink, unplug everything and flip it over.</li>
<li>Remove the 4 screws at the bottom and using the fabric tab pull up
the cover gently.</li>
<li>The harddisk slot under the bottom cover was already connected by a
cable to the motherboard.</li>
<li>All I did was to slide the hard disk or SSD into the slot and press
until it locks into the interface inside.</li>
<li>You can secure it with up to 4 screws provided in the box, but the
holes were slightly misaligned with my hard disk so I could not do
it.</li>
<li>Close the cover and screw in. Reboot and enjoy.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bluetooth">Bluetooth</h2>
<p>After a Ubuntu upgrade, I found that the Bluetooth settings dialog
was saying <code>No Bluetooth found</code>. It turned out that the Linux
kernel module for Bluetooth devices <code>btusb</code> was not
loaded.</p>
<p>I loaded it using this command and Bluetooth started working
immediately:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo modprobe btusb</code></pre>
<h2 id="disconnecting-wifi">Disconnecting Wifi</h2>
<p>After a recent Ubuntu upgrade, the wifi connection with my home
router started to disconnect and reconnect every 2 minutes.</p>
<p>dmesg showed these logs repeating every 2 minutes:</p>
<pre><code>1386:[Tue Nov  4 15:35:49 2025] wlo1: 80 MHz not supported, disabling VHT
1387:[Tue Nov  4 15:35:49 2025] wlo1: authenticate with &lt;Wifi router MAC address&gt;
1388:[Tue Nov  4 15:35:49 2025] wlo1: send auth to &lt;Wifi router MAC address&gt; (try 1/3)
1388:[Tue Nov  4 15:35:49 2025] wlo1: send auth to &lt;Wifi router MAC address&gt; (try 2/3)
1388:[Tue Nov  4 15:35:49 2025] wlo1: send auth to &lt;Wifi router MAC address&gt; (try 3/3)
1391:[Tue Nov  4 15:35:50 2025] wlo1: authentication &lt;Wifi router MAC address&gt; timed out</code></pre>
<p>From the above logs, we see that authentication is timing out and so
our connection is disconnecting.</p>
<p>First suggestion was to open
<code>/etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/default-wifi-powersave-on.conf</code>,
set <code>wifi.powersave = 0</code> and restart
<code>sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager</code>. This did not fix the
problem.</p>
<p>The 80 MHz band and VHT (Very High Throughput) are from the 5 MHz
network, so I disabled 5 MHz wifi in the router settings. This still did
not fix the problem. To make sure this was cleanly applied, I restarted
the wifi router and also the Beelink’s NetworkManager. This seemed to
fix the problem.</p>
