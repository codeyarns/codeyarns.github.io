<h1 id="problem">Problem</h1>
<p>I installed <strong>Ubuntu 16.04</strong> on a new notebook that had <strong>Intel Wireless-AC 3165</strong> hardware to provide wifi and Bluetooth connectivity. This hardware was working without any problems in <strong>Windows 10</strong>, without requiring any extra software installation. However, the wireless and Bluetooth features did not work in Ubuntu.</p>
<h1 id="solution">Solution</h1>
<p>There are many solutions offered on the web to enable wireless connectivity. Copying the ucode files provided by Intel <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/network-and-i-o/wireless-networking/000005511.html">here</a> to <code>/lib/firmware</code> definitely did not work.</p>
<p>I was using Ubuntu 16.04, which was using the Linux 4.4.x kernel. One of the suggestions online is that newer kernels have better support for Intel wireless hardware.</p>
<p>Ubuntu provides newer versions of Linux kernel and X in updated HWE stacks. I installed the latest available HWE stack for Ubuntu 16.04, as described <a href="https://codeyarns.com/2017/05/19/the-hwe-stack-for-ubuntu-lts/">here</a>. This installed a 4.8.x kernel and my wireless and Bluetooth worked like magic without requiring any configuration after a reboot.</p>
<p>I have also tried to manually install a newer Linux kernel. Ubuntu developers provide installers of all newer Linux kernels. So I decided to try my luck with the latest 4.9.x series and installed it as described <a href="https://codeyarns.com/2017/02/04/how-to-update-linux-kernel-in-ubuntu/">here</a>. This also enabled me to use this Intel wireless adapter without any problem!</p>
