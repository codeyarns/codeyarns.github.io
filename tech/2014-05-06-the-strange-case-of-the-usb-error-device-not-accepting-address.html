<h1 class="title">The strange case of the USB error: device not
accepting address</h1>

<h2 id="problem">Problem</h2>
<p>I connected a USB mouse to a notebook running Ubuntu 14.04. The mouse
was not detected. In fact, it turned out that no USB device was being
detected on connecting to the notebook.</p>
<p>To eliminate hardware error, I rebooted into Windows. The USB mouse
was detected and worked fine on it!</p>
<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>
<p>On rebooting back to Ubuntu, I noticed an error message involving USB
just because the Ubuntu desktop was displayed. On looking in
<code>/var/log/syslog</code>, I found error lines of this form:</p>
<pre><code>usb 3-7: device not accepting address 2, error -62
usb 3-7: new full-speed USB device number 3 using xhci_hcd

usb 3-7: device not accepting address 2, error -108</code></pre>
<p>No amount of searching and trying fixes seemed to help. I thought
that this is a software driver problem. I also wondered how the same
hardware and software had worked well just a couple of days ago. What
could have gone wrong in 2 days on this notebook where nothing had been
touched or tampered with?</p>
<p>After looking high and low, I finally landed on the <a
href="http://paulphilippov.com/articles/how-to-fix-device-not-accepting-address-error">strange
post by Paul Philippov</a> where he suggested that this could be due to
the USB hub or ports being hot or drawing too much power. I noted that
the notebook had been running for many days now. Could some fickle
cooling problem have caused this?</p>
<p>I shutdown Ubuntu and left the notebook powered down for 15 minutes.
I powered back on and all the USB ports worked! What a strange
solution!!! 😊</p>
