<p>Eclipse has support for version control systems like Git, SVN and
CVS. Support for Mercurial can be enabled by using the MercurialEclipse
plugin. When viewing files in version control, it is common practice to
quickly see which of the lines are uncommitted compared to the current
head (or parent) revision. This information can be viewed in Eclipse by
using its Quick Diff feature. This is easy to do:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Go to Window -&gt; Preferences -&gt; General -&gt; Editors -&gt;
Text Editors -&gt; Quick Diff. This is the dialog from where it can be
configured.</p></li>
<li><p>Turn on Quick Diff, by enabling the option
<code>Enable quick diff</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Choose the version control system for which Quick Diff is needed
from the dropdown <code>Use this reference source</code>. Git, SVN and
CVS should be present here. Mercurial appears if the MercurialEclipse
plugin is installed.</p></li>
<li><p>The overview ruler is the ruler to the right of the scrollbar in
the editor. If you would like to see the uncommitted lines to be marked
on it, enable the option
<code>Show differences in overview ruler</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Choose Apply and OK. Close all editor windows and reopen the
source file that you want in the editor.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>You should be able to see the newly added, modified or deleted lines
marked in colors in the left bar on which line numbers are usually
displayed. The colors used are the ones set in the Quick Diff dialog
(see above steps). You can also view these uncommitted locations marked
along the overview ruler on the right.</p>
<p><strong>Tried with:</strong> Eclipse Luna 4.4.1 and Ubuntu 14.04</p>
