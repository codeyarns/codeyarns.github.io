<p>Came across a puzzling piece of code today. The actual code is confusing, however it basically boils down to this:</p>
<pre><code>#include &lt;stdint.h&gt;

int main()
{
    uint32_t val   = 1;
    uint32_t count = 32;
    val            = val &gt;&gt; count;

    return 0;
}</code></pre>
<p>What do you think will be the result in val? Me thought 0. Turned out to be 1.</p>
<p>After further investigation, I found that this was due to a combination of an undefined behaviour in C, vague behaviour of certain IA-32 architecture operations and my ignorance of both.</p>
<p>On examining the code above, it is natural to think that 32 right shifts applied on <code>val</code> would boot out the puny 1 and the result would be 0. Though this is right almost always, it has some exceptions.</p>
<p>From The C Programming Language [1]:</p>
<blockquote>
The result is undefined if the right operand is negative, or greater than or <strong>equal</strong> to the number of bits in the left expression's type.
</blockquote>
<p>(Taking <code>val &gt;&gt; count</code> as example, left expression is <code>val</code> and right operand is <code>count</code>.)</p>
<p>So, that explains why the result should not be relied on. But why <code>val</code> is 1? On digging deeper for that, I found that the compiler [2] generated the Intel instruction <code>sar</code> or <code>shr</code> (or it's variants) for the C shift operation. And here lies another nasty info ...</p>
<p>From the IA-32 Intel Architecture Software Developer’s Manual [3]:</p>
<blockquote>
The 8086 does not mask the shift count. However, all other IA-32 processors (starting with the Intel 286 processor) do mask the shift count to 5 bits, resulting in a maximum count of 31. This masking is done in all operating modes (including the virtual-8086 mode) to reduce the maximum execution time of the instructions.
</blockquote>
<p>So, not only is the behaviour in C undefined, on code generated for IA-32 processors, a 5 bit mask is applied on the shift count. This means that on IA-32 processors, the range of a shift count will be 0-31 only.</p>
