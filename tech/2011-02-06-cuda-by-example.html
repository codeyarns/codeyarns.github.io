<p>With single processor speeds having hit a wall, there is a lot of
interest in heterogeneous computing today. One of the popular ways to
speed up applications is to rewrite them as massively parallel
applications that execute on the NVIDIA <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA"><strong>CUDA</strong></a>
architecture. It is quite hard to think of parallel solutions to
existing problems and writing CUDA programs can be a minefield. These
factors have made learning to swim in the choppy waters of CUDA
difficult for beginners. Despite an abundance of CUDA information on the
web, there has been no introductory material that is both simple and of
good quality. The new book <a
href="http://developer.nvidia.com/object/cuda-by-example.html"><strong>CUDA
by Example: An Introduction to General-Purpose GPU
Programming</strong></a> written by <strong>Jason Sanders</strong> and
<strong>Edward Kandrot</strong> (both NVIDIA employees) aims to be such
an introductory book for CUDA programming.</p>
<p>The only <em>prerequisite</em> expected of this book’s reader is
knowledge of C. Spread over 12 quick chapters, the book uses example
CUDA C programs all through to introduce concepts and explain their
usage. Every example program is thoroughly broken down and the authors
explain every stage of the process. It is quite heartening to see this
detailed hand-holding extend all the way through to the complex concepts
and last chapters. Chapters 1-5 are essential reading and the reader
should be able to write simple CUDA programs after this point. The rest
of the chapters acquaint concepts which are useful to further optimize
the CUDA solution to take advantage of the problem domain or the CUDA
architecture or both.</p>

<p>The book is strictly introductory, thankfully, and does not explain
the CUDA architecture and its inner workings. I cannot commend the
authors enough for taking this hard-line and making the jump into CUDA
as simple and painless as they have done here. It would be natural to
read the <a
href="https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html"><strong>CUDA
Programming Guide</strong></a> after this and keep it around as a
reference for CUDA programming. This book is perfect for any inquisitive
programmer wanting a taste of CUDA to see if it is worth her time. The
avid reader can finish this book, having worked the examples and
understood the major concepts, easily over a weekend.</p>
<p>Example code and errata of the book can be found <a

<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/4</p>
