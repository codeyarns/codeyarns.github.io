<h2 id="problem">Problem</h2>
<p>Deciding to educate myself, I recently picked up a 10-DVD box set of
<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Original_Series_season_1"><strong>Star
Trek: The Original Series (Season 1)</strong></a>. I plopped the first
DVD into a <a
href="https://electronics.sony.com/tv-video/blu-ray-dvd-players/dvd-players/p/dvpsr510h"><strong>Sony
DVP-SR510H</strong></a> player that was connected over HDMI to a <a
href="https://www.hisense-usa.com/product-page/televisions-55-inch-a6-series-led-4k-uhd-smart-google-tv-2021-55a65h"><strong>Hisense
55A6H</strong></a> TV running <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_TV#Google_TV_interface">Google
TV</a>. The remastered video and audio sounded great, but the DVD did
not seem to have English subtitles. It only had French and Spanish
subtitles and when chosen those were displayed correctly.</p>
<p>For many years now, I have relied on English subtitles when watching
TV series and movies. It seemed surprising that the release of such a
popular TV series would be missing English subtitles.</p>
<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>
<p>Looking at the back of the box, it had the logos for <strong>CC
(Closed Captions)</strong> and <strong>NTSC</strong>. I already knew
that CC was information transmitted along with the analog TV signals.
And since Star Trek was a TV series, it made sense that the DVD creators
decided to retain the original CC info transmitted over NTSC video in
the discs. How to get this CC info out from the DVD and display on the
TV?</p>
<p>Checking online, I found that this CC info <em>cannot</em> be
transmitted over HDMI. So, I hooked up the 3-color <strong>component
video cable</strong> that has yellow (for video) and red-white (for
right-left audio) to the DVD player and the TV. In the TV inputs, I
chose <em>AV</em> and I knew I was getting NTSC video since it was
noticeably lower quality than HDMI video. However, no CC info was
displayed.</p>
<p>Next, I dug into the Google TV settings for CC and enabled all of it.
This is Settings -&gt; Accessibility -&gt; Captions. Still no CC
info!</p>
<p>Finally, I suspected that the DVD player was messing with the raw
analog output before sending it to the TV. So, I dove into its screen
setup -&gt; Mode (Progressive) and changed from <em>Auto</em> to
<em>Video</em>.</p>
<p>Finally, I was able to see the original English version of Closed
Captions on the Star Trek video!</p>
<p>PS: The same trick did not work on my portable <strong>Sony
DVP-FX950</strong> DVD player. Probably because it is only sending
digital video to its internal display and does not have any option to
use the analog video info.</p>
