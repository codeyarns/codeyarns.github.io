<h1 id="problem">Problem</h1>
<p>I had a new notebook computer with no operating system installed on it. I had a <strong>Windows 8</strong> license and a Windows 8 ISO which I wanted to use to install on this notebook. I prepared a Windows installer USB thumbdrive using the ISO and booted the notebook from it.</p>
<p>The computer would throw this error and keep restarting:</p>
<pre><code>Your PC ran into a problem and needs to restart.
If you&#39;d like to know more you can search online later for this error: ACPI_BIOS_ERROR</code></pre>
<h1 id="solution">Solution</h1>
<p>Searching online for this error, I found that this occurred to most people when they were updating or upgrading. Mine was neither, I was installing on a fresh computer. In any case, their solutions were either inapplicable or did not work.</p>
<p>While looking up solutions for this error, I discovered that I could use my Windows 8 license to install the newer <strong>Windows 10</strong>. I decided to give this a try, since Windows 10 ISO is easily available for download <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/software-download/windows10ISO">here</a>. I made a Windows installer USB thumbdrive and surprise, it booted up normally and I was able to install Windows 10 Pro without any further problems!</p>
