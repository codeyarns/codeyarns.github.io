<h1 class="title">Ubuntu RPi freeze during C++ compilation</h1>

<p>I was <a
href="2021-02-07-how-to-build-veracrypt-from-source.html">compiling</a>
the Veracrypt C++ source code when the system froze up completely. This
was on my <strong>Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+</strong> board which was
running Ubuntu 20.04. The system was unfrozen only after about 30
minutes and I saw this error at the shell:</p>
<pre><code>$ make
...
g++: fatal error: Killed signal terminated program cc1plus
compilation terminated.
make[1]: *** [/home/ashwin/VeraCrypt-VeraCrypt_1.24-Update7/src/Build/Include/Makefile.inc:28: CommandLineInterface.o] Error 1
make[1]: *** Waiting for unfinished jobs....
g++: fatal error: Killed signal terminated program cc1plus
compilation terminated.
make[1]: *** [/home/ashwin/VeraCrypt-VeraCrypt_1.24-Update7/src/Build/Include/Makefile.inc:28: FavoriteVolume.o] Error 1
make: *** [Makefile:424: all] Error 2</code></pre>
<p>Looking up <code>/var/log/syslog</code> I noticed that the kernel had
detected that the system was hung. It would wait for 120 seconds, the
time specified in <code>/proc/sys/kernel/hung_task_timeout_secs</code>,
and then try again. It did this for about 20 minutes and about 10
minutes after that the C++ compiler invoked the <strong>OOM
killer</strong>: <code>cc1plus invoked oom-killer</code>. The killer
killed the C++ compiler and the system was unfrozen.</p>
<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>
<p>It looked like the C++ compiler was running out of RAM. I had seen <a
href="2019-05-12-out-of-memory-error-on-raspbian.html">this problem
earlier</a> on Raspbian, where the solution had been to increase the
size of its <strong>swap file</strong>.</p>
<p>But Ubuntu seemed to neither use a swap file nor a swap partition on
the Raspberry Pi. So I looked for other solutions.</p>
<p>On my computers, I set <code>MAKEFLAGS</code> to use all the
available CPU cores for faster builds. Since the <a
href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/bcm2837b0/README.md">BCM2837B0</a>
chip used in my RPi has a quad-core ARM CPU, I had set the flag to
<code>--jobs=4</code>. This meant that 4 instances of the C++ compiler
were running in parallel when the system ran out of memory.</p>
<p>I reduced the 4 to 1 and I was able to compile without any further
hiccups.</p>
