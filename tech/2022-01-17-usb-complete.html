<p>Recently, I wanted to learn about the many USB versions and their capabilities. Looking for something easier than the USB standard documents to study, I chose <a href="http://janaxelson.com/usbc.htm"><strong>USB Complete: The Developer‚Äôs Guide</strong></a>. Written by <a href="http://janaxelson.com/"><strong>Jan Axelson</strong></a>, the book seemed to be pretty popular since it was already in the 5th edition.</p>
<p>The most relevant USB versions seem to be 2.0, 3.0 and 3.1. Low (1.5 Mbps), full (12 Mbps) and high (480 Mbps) speeds are available in 2.0, <strong>SuperSpeed</strong> (5 Gbps) was introduced in 3.0 and <strong>SuperSpeed Plus</strong> (10 Gbps) in 3.1.</p>
<p>Various transfer types are supported in USB. Control transfers are used with all devices for enumeration and discovery. Isochronous transfers are used with audio devices, interrupt transfers with keyboards, mice and bulk transfers for storage data transfer.</p>
<p>There are various classes of devices supported by USB: like <strong>mass storage</strong> or <strong>HID</strong> (human interface device) as examples. Since OSes ship with class drivers, this enables creators of devices to focus on just hardware development and not worry about driver development.</p>
<p>There were good illustrations showing the possible tree of controllers, hubs and devices in 2.0 and 3.1. The host computer needs to have one controller (or more) and a root hub with ports. The ports on the hub can connect downstream to more hubs (with their own ports) or to devices.</p>
<p>Tools like the Windows <strong>device manager</strong> or <strong>USBLPM</strong> can be used to examine the USB controllers, hubs and devices on a computer. (Personally, I prefer USBView <a href="2011-12-21-usb-view-on-windows.html">on Windows</a> and <a href="2015-07-30-usbview-on-linux.html">on Linux</a> though.)</p>
<p>One of the great USB features is that it can deliver some power to devices: upto 500 mA in 2.0 and 900 mA in 3.1 at a nominal voltage of 5V. The new power revision supported up to 5A and 20V, for a total power of 100W.</p>
<p>A chapter towards the end also looked at the various USB connectors. 2.0 has 4 wires and uses type A connectors for host and device and various type B connectors for devices, like micro-B. 3.0 has 10 wires and uses new <strong>Type-C</strong> connectors which can connect to both hosts and devices and are reversible.</p>
<p>Written for developers, the book covers a lot more which I skipped over: protocol analysers, Windows device drivers, USB chips and boards. I wish there was more information about the new power revision - this was the one sore point. Also, a lot of the information is duplicated across chapters and the book could have done with a closer proofread. Minor quibbles aside, this was a good resource to learn all about USB. I came away clearly knowing USB‚Äôs strengths, limitations and jargon.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 3/4</p>
