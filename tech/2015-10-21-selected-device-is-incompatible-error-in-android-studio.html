<h1 id="problem">Problem</h1>
<p>I was following a tutorial to learn using <strong>Android Studio</strong>. I connected my Android device which has <strong>USB Debugging</strong> enabled. After creating a new project, I tried to <strong>Run</strong> it. In the <strong>Device Chooser</strong> window, I could see my device listed. However, in the <strong>Compatible</strong> column, it was shown as incompatible and the message below read &quot;The selected device is incompatible&quot;. This was even though the <strong>minimum SDK</strong> version was lower than the SDK/OS of my device.</p>
<h1 id="solution">Solution</h1>
<p>Follow all the steps of the <a href="http://developer.android.com/tools/device.html"><strong>Using hardware devices</strong></a> guide:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Enable debugging in the <code>app/build.gradle</code> file.</p></li>
<li><p>Add new UDEV rules for your device. You will need to look up the <a href="http://developer.android.com/tools/device.html#VendorIds"><strong>Vendor ID</strong></a> of your phone and create the <code>/etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules</code> file.</p></li>
<li><p>Reconnect the device and it will prompt to accept a RSA key from the computer. Accept it.</p></li>
<li><p>Check if the device is listed using the <code>adb</code> tool:</p></li>
</ul>
<pre><code>$ ~/Android/Sdk/platform-tools/adb devices</code></pre>
<p>Now try to Run the app on the device. In the Device Chooser window, you should be able to see the full device name, compared to the codename which was shown earlier. This is a clue that everything is working. Your app should appear on your device in a few moments!</p>
<p><strong>Tried with:</strong> Android Studio 1.4, Moto G2 XT1068 and Ubuntu 14.04</p>
