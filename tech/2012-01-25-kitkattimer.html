<p><em>&quot;Have a break ... have a Kit Kat!&quot;</em></p>
<p>A lot of digital ink has been spilled about the problems of our sedentary lifestyles. Recently, I realized that sometimes I too was sitting in my chair working at the computer for 2-3 hours without getting up!</p>
<p>I wrote a tiny application called <a href="https://bitbucket.org/ashwin/kitkattimer"><strong>KitKatTimer</strong></a> that sits in the system tray and reminds me to take a break when I have been sitting on my bum for a long time. It is written in C# and uses <strong>Snarl</strong> to display its notifications. (For information on Snarl go <a href="http://codeyarns.wordpress.com/2012/01/21/snarl/">here</a>.) It knows when you are not at the computer by listening to the system idle, locked or asleep statuses. The code for KitKatTimer can be obtained <a href="https://bitbucket.org/ashwin/kitkattimer">here</a>.</p>
