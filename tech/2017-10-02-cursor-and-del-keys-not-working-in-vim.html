<h1 id="problem">Problem</h1>
<p>After changing some configurations in a <strong>vimrc</strong>, I noticed that the keys that move the cursor in Insert mode of Vim did not work. Even the Del key did nothing but move the cursor.</p>
<h1 id="solution">Solution</h1>
<p>After examining the configuration I had added to my vimrc, I found that this behavior was caused by setting <code>set noesckeys</code>. Turns out that this setting disables cursor keys in Insert mode. I did not really need that feature, so I took out that line. This leaves the default <code>set esckeys</code> setting which works as expected.</p>
<p><strong>Tried with:</strong> Vim 7.4 and Ubuntu 16.04</p>
