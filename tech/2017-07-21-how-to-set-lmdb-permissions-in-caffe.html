<h1 class="title">How to set LMDB permissions in Caffe</h1>

<p><strong>Caffe</strong> can create, read and write images from an <strong>LMDB</strong> database. This is much faster than using the files from filesystem during training. However, I noticed that by default Caffe would not set <strong>write</strong> permissions for my <strong>group</strong> for the lmdb directory.</p>
<p>A quick investigation into <code>src/caffe/util/db_lmdb.cpp</code> showed that this was because new lmdb directory was being created with <code>0744</code> permissions. I changed this to <code>0774</code> in the code and recompiled Caffe.</p>
<p>Now comes the mystery: Caffe still created lmdb directories where my group did not have write permission!</p>
<p>Further investigation showed that the default umask in Linux is <code>0022</code>. This umask does not allow the group write permissions to be set.</p>
<p>Ok, so then I set the umask at the shell to <code>0002</code> and tried to create the lmdb again. Found that lmdb directories still did not have group write permissions!</p>
<p>I was creating the lmdb databases from a script that ran the <code>convert_imageset</code> binary. Now the binary was run by using the <code>exec</code> command of the Bash shell. This replaces the currently running process with the <code>convert_imageset</code> binary. However, unlike a fork, the new process is not passed the umask of the parent process by the OS! This was the reason for the problem.</p>
<p>Once I knew this, the solution was easy. I modified the <code>tools/convert_imageset.cpp</code> code and added this code:</p>
<pre><code>#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;

// In the main function ...
umask(0002);
// ....</code></pre>
<p>This solved the problem perfectly! :)</p>
