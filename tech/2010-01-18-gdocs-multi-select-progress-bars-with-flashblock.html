<p><em>Google Docs</em> now allows you to <a href="http://googledocs.blogspot.com/2010/01/upload-and-store-your-files-in-cloud.html">upload any kind of file</a> into their online storage. I guess they noticed that people were emailing themselves lots of files to keep them stored online.</p>
<p>The GDocs file upload process has the same multi-select and progress bar capability as in Gmail. And similar to Gmail, it will not work properly if Flash is being blocked by the <em>Flashblock</em> addon. So, the fix for this problem is the <a href="http://codeyarns.wordpress.com/2010/01/13/gmail-multi-select-progress-bars-with-flashblock/">same as for Gmail</a>: Add <code>docs.google.com</code> to the Flashblock whitelist.</p>
