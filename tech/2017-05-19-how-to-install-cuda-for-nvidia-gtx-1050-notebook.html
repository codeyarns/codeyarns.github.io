<p>Installing NVIDIA graphics drivers on Linux has never been easy for me! I bought a notebook with <strong>NVIDIA GTX 1050</strong> GPU recently and installed Kubuntu 16.04. I had to wait for more than a month for NVIDIA to release drivers that supported the notebook 1050 variant.</p>
<ul>
<li>Once the driver was released, I downloaded the <code>.run</code> file directly from NVIDIA's website <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/unix.html">here</a>. I ran the installation:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>$ sudo sh NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-381.22.run</code></pre>
<p>When I rebooted, I got a black screen! Not surprising with NVIDIA and Linux! I had to uninstall it to get back to work:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo sh NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-381.22.run --uninstall</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>After another month, I found that the latest NVIDIA driver supporting the notebook 1050 was available from Ubuntu. So, I tried installing that:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>$ sudo apt install nvidia-381</code></pre>
<p>Reboot and I got a new error message in a GUI dialog box:</p>
<pre><code>The system is running in low-graphics mode
Your screen, graphics card, and input device settings could not be detected correctly.
You will need to configure these yourself.</code></pre>
<p>I had to uninstall it to get back to work:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo apt purge nvidia-381</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>It finally dawned on me that what I really wanted was to be able to run CUDA programs on the GPU. I did not really care about X or games being able to use the GPU. So, I went back to the <code>.run</code> driver and installed it without OpenGL:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>$ sudo sh NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-381.22.run --no-opengl-files</code></pre>
<p>After rebooting, I found that I still had a desktop. That was a big relief! I proceeded to download and install CUDA:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo sh cuda_8.0.61_375.26_linux.run</code></pre>
<p>I took care to <strong>not</strong> install the graphics driver that comes along with the CUDA installer. That is it! I was able to compile and run the CUDA samples. Running <code>./deviceQuery</code> from the samples showed the GTX 1050 and that is all I wanted! :)</p>
