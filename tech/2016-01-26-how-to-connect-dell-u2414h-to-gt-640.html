<h1 id="problem">Problem</h1>
<p>I was using a computer with a <strong>NVIDIA GeForce GT 640</strong> graphics card. I got a new <strong>Dell U2414H</strong> display. The display could take only two types of inputs: <strong>DisplayPort</strong> and <strong>HDMI</strong>. The graphics card had three types of output: <strong>VGA</strong>, <strong>DVI</strong> and HDMI. How to connect them together?</p>
<h1 id="solution">Solution</h1>
<p>I had both VGA and DVI cables for the graphics card. To connect either of these up to the display, I tried VGA-to-DisplayPort and DVI-to-DisplayPort adapters. Strangely neither of these were detected by the display. It continued to show that no DisplayPort cable was connected.</p>
<p>The reason for this strange behavior turns out to be that VGA or DVI cannot be upconverted to DisplayPort! Instead I used a HDMI cable and solved the problem.</p>
