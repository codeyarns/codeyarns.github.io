<p>Today I was trying to look up the occurrence of either of 3 terms in a huge log file. I had the text file open in Vim and wanted to hop to the occurrences of either term. I could have grepped the file, but highlighting of the search terms and having the ability to peek around the occurrence of these terms was important to me.</p>
<p>I was able to do this using the <strong><a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2826">multisearch</a></strong> plugin. This is the latest in a series of Vim plugins written for this purpose by several authors over the years. The multisearch plugin is offered as a <strong>vimball</strong> file and can be downloaded from the bottom of the <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2826">plugin page</a>. There are 2 versions available, pick the Unix version if you are on Linux, pick the other one if you are on Windows. For help with installing a vimball, see <a href="http://codeyarns.wordpress.com/2010/04/15/vim-vimballs/">this post</a>.</p>
<p>Once multisearch is installed, open up the text file you want to search. To search for the occurrence of 3 terms, say <code>Amar</code>, <code>Akbar</code> and <code>Anthony</code> use:</p>
<pre><code>:Msearch add /Amar/
:Msearch add /Akbar/
:Msearch add /Anthony/</code></pre>
<p>You will find each of these search terms highlighted with different colors across your text file. Very nice!</p>
<p>To hop to the next occurrence of any of these terms in sequence use repeatedly:</p>
<pre><code>:Msearch</code></pre>
<p>Note that if you do not mind your multiple search terms being highlighted with the same color, then you need no plugin. Such a search capability is built into Vim. See <a href="http://codeyarns.wordpress.com/2012/05/07/search-multiple-terms-in-vim/">this post</a> for more information.</p>
