<p>The <strong>Console</strong> is one of the windows that is typically placed at the bottom of <strong>Eclipse</strong>. It is used to display the build output when compiling files and it is also used to display the console output written out by your program.</p>
<p>There is a limit to the number of characters or lines that the Console will hold. If your build or output is more than this limit, then the characters or lines at the top of the Console are silently removed. This can be problematic since it is very common for build outputs to be very verbose or for your program to spew a lot of output to the standard output. Thankfully, these limits can be changed or increased easily.</p>
<p>To change or increase the limit on number of lines of build output for C/C++, go to: Settings &gt; C/C++ &gt; Build &gt; Console. The entry we need to change here is <strong>Limit console output (number of lines)</strong>. The default limit is a tiny 500 lines. Increase it to a larger number like 10000.</p>
<p>To change or increase the limit on buffer size for output from your program, go to: <em>Windows</em> &gt; <em>Preferences</em> &gt; <em>Run/Debug</em> &gt; <em>Console</em>. The entry we need to change here is <strong>Console buffer size (characters)</strong>. The default limit is a small 80000 characters. Change it to a larger number like 1000000.</p>
<p><strong>Tried with:</strong> Eclipse 3.7.2 and Ubuntu 12.04</p>
