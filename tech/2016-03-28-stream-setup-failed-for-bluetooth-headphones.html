<h2 id="problem">Problem</h2>
<p>I have a Bluetooth adapter and a Bluetooth headset which worked fine on an Ubuntu system. I now plug them into another XUbuntu system. It uses <strong>Blueman</strong>, a GTK-based GUI tool for managing Bluetooth devices. I can discover the headset and connect to it. However, it does not appear as an Output Device in Sound Settings. So, I cannot use it as Audio Sink for any playback.</p>
<p>On diagnosing the problem in Blueman, it gives this error for this headset: <code>Connection Failed: Stream setup failed</code></p>
<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>
<p>It turned out that this computer first had Ubuntu and XUbuntu was installed on top of it. Ubuntu uses a GNOME Bluetooth manager and XUbuntu uses Blueman.</p>
<p>To solve this problem, I uninstalled Blueman:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo apt-get purge blueman</code></pre>
<p>After restarting, I used only the GNOME Bluetooth manager and was able to connect the headset. It appeared as Output Device in Sound Settings and I was able to use it to listen to audio.</p>
<p><strong>Tried with:</strong> Creative WP-300 headphones, ioGear Bluetooth adapter GBU521 and Ubuntu 14.04</p>
