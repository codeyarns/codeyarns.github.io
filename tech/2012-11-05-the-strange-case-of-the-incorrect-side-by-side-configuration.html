<p>A week ago <strong>VirtualBox</strong> informed that a new version was available and that I should update to it. I proceeded to get the latest version using Chrome, which downloaded as the file <strong>VirtualBox-4.2.4-81684-Win.exe</strong>. On executing the file, I got this error:</p>
<blockquote>
The application has failed to start because its side-by-side configuration is incorrect. Please see the application event log or use the command-line sxstrace.exe tool for more detail.
</blockquote>
<p>This error was a bit troubling to me because I have not seen any DLL or SxS problems with Windows 7 and recent versions of software. Those happen mostly with older versions of Windows and older software.</p>
<p>Searching online for this error leads to suggestions that one should install a particular version of the <strong>Visual C++ Redistributable</strong> package. None of those solved the problem however.</p>
<p>I finally suspected the file itself. File downloads rarely get corrupted these days, but it can still happen. So, I downloaded the file again and it installed without any complaint! :-)</p>
<p>Just to confirm I opened up the two files in WinMerge and found that there were a few bytes at the end of the second file missing from the first downloaded file.</p>
<p><strong>Tried with:</strong> VirtualBoxÂ 4.2.4 and Windows 7 Enterprise</p>
