<h1 class="title">Kobo Nia</h1>

<p>I generally read deadtree books, but a couple of years ago I decided to pull the trigger and try an ebook reader. Wanting to try something other than the <strong>Kindle</strong> series, I chose the <a href="https://us.kobobooks.com/products/kobo-nia"><strong>Kobo Nia</strong></a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Kobo is a company owned by Rakuten Japan, but is based in Canada that produces ebook readers.</li>
<li>The Nia is their smallest and simplest ebook reader, with a 6-inch display. The display is 1024x758 resolution and has 212 PPI. It is fine for reading text, but not sufficient if you are viewing images or reading comics.</li>
<li>The reader was really light! I am used to Android tablets and smartphones, which are quite heavy. Ebook readers, though larger than those, are far lighter, which is quite a nice selling point. The reader is 172 grams, but distributed across its larger dimensions, this hardly feels like anything when using it.</li>
<li>The rendering of text on the display, the brightness levels are great. One of the best features of ebook readers is how easy they are to read in sunlight and how easy they are on the eye (like paper). This reader also has a front light for reading in the dark called <em>ComfortLight</em>, which was barely adequate though.</li>
<li>Charging the ebook reader is easy by connecting it using a micro-USB cable. Once charged, the battery seemed to last for one month, for the little reading I do on it.</li>
<li>Ebooks can be purchased through the app in the reader or borrowed from your library using the installed <a href="2022-02-09-overdrive.html"><strong>OverDrive</strong></a> app. I used the OverDrive app to read a few books from my library and the experience was good. It was a tad disappointing that the app did not support magazines, which it supports in its Android apps.</li>
<li>Connecting the ebook reader to the computer shows it up as a mass storage device. By copying over files to the device, you can read them on the ebook reader. This is another killer feature since you can read epub, PDF and comic book files this way.</li>
<li>The biggest selling point of the reader for me was the Pocket app. I can sync and read all my Pocket articles on this reader. The text view works great, but the web view might crash the inbuilt browser. Reading the articles also makes me wish this was a color ebook reader.</li>
</ul>
