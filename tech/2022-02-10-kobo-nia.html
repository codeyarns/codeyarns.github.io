<h1 class="title">Kobo Nia</h1>

<p>I generally read deadtree books, but a couple of years ago I decided to pull the trigger and try an ebook reader. Wanting to try something other than the <strong>Kindle</strong> series, I chose the <a href="https://us.kobobooks.com/products/kobo-nia"><strong>Kobo Nia</strong></a>. Kobo is a company owned by Rakuten Japan, but is based in Canada that produces ebook readers.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Display</strong>: The Nia is Kobo‚Äôs smallest and simplest ebook reader, with a 6-inch display. Its resolution is 1024x758 and has 212 PPI. It is fine for reading text, but not sufficient if you are viewing images or reading comics.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Weight</strong>: The reader was really light! I am used to Android tablets and smartphones, which are quite heavy compared to this reader. Ebook readers, though larger than those, are far lighter, which is quite a nice selling point. The reader is 172 grams, but distributed across its larger dimensions, this hardly feels like anything when using it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Light</strong>: The rendering of text on the display, the brightness levels are great. One of the best features of ebook readers is how easy they are to read in sunlight and how easy they are on the eye (like paper). This reader also has a front light for reading in the dark called <em>ComfortLight</em>, which was barely adequate though.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Battery</strong>: Charging the ebook reader is easy by connecting it using a micro-USB cable. Once charged, the battery seemed to last for one month, for the little reading I do on it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Copy ebooks from computer</strong>: The Kobo can be connected to a computer using a USB cable and no special software is required. It appears as a USB mass storage device with the drive name <code>KOBOeReader</code>. By copying over ebook files to this drive, you can read them on the Kobo. This is another killer feature since you can read any ebook in any format (epub/PDF/comic) this way. Note that the Nia is also recognized in <a href="2012-02-26-view-ebooks-with-calibre.html"><strong>Calibre</strong></a> when it is connected, enabling the transfer of ebooks/magazines/newspapers available in Calibre to the Kobo.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Buy or borrow ebooks</strong>: Ebooks can be purchased through the Kobo store app in the reader or borrowed from your library using the installed <a href="2022-02-09-overdrive.html"><strong>OverDrive</strong></a> app. I used the OverDrive app to read a few books from my library and the experience was good. It was a tad disappointing that the app did not support magazines, which it supports in its Android apps.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pocket</strong>: The biggest selling point of the reader for me was the Pocket app. I can sync and read all my Pocket articles on this reader. The text view works great, but the web view might crash the inbuilt browser. Reading the articles also makes me wish this was a color ebook reader.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Software</strong>: The software used in Kobo ebooks is called <em>eReader</em>. No matter whether you are reading an ebook (bought/borrowed/copied) or a Pocket article, they all use the same Reader interface when the ebook/article is open. Pressing in the middle of the display allows you to set the brightness, font face, font size, line spacing, margins, justification and other settings at the top. At the bottom, you get access to the scrollbar to scroll through pages, table of contents, current chapter/article name, your annotations for the book and search.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dictionary</strong>: Long-pressing any word in an ebook or Pocket article will show its meaning using the <a href="https://codeyarns.com/personal/2021-08-23-english-dictionaries.html">ODE</a>. I think the access to this high-quality Oxford dictionary with display of meaning, pronunciation, usage and etymology is a fantastic feature. There are also dictionaries in other languages (which I don‚Äôt use) and Spanish/French/German-&gt;English dictionaries (which I do use) that can be enabled in settings. Words from Spanish/German/French are common while reading English and so I find the access to all these European-&gt;English dictionaries to be a huge plus.</p></li>
