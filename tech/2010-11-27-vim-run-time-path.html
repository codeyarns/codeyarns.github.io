<p>The <strong>run-time path</strong> is a list of directories where <strong>ViM</strong> looks for files related to its settings, color schemes, documentation and plugins. The current run-time path can be see by typing:</p>
<pre><code>:set runtimepath?</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><p>One of the directories in the run-time path is <code>$VIMRUNTIME</code>, which on Windows points to the installation directory which contains the ViM executable. For example, it is <code>C:\Program Files (x86)\Vim\vim73</code> on 64-bit Windows 7. This directory contains the plugins and settings files that ship with a ViM installation. This directory is deleted when ViM is upgraded to a new version. So, it is not a good idea to store any plugins or settings here.</p></li>
<li><p>Another directory in the run-time path is <code>$VIM/vimfiles</code>. On Windows, <code>$VIM</code> typically points to the parent directory of <code>$VIMRUNTIME</code>. For example, it is <code>C:\Program Files (x86)\Vim</code> on my setup. <code>$VIM/vimfiles</code> is a good place to place global settings and plugins. The user needs administrator access to place files in this directory.</p></li>
<li><p>Neither of the above directories is a good place for store user-specific plugins. On Windows 7, the user needs administrator privileges to add to the above directories anyway. The best place for the user to install plugins is thus <code>~/vimfiles</code>, which expands to <code>$HOME/vimfiles</code> on Windows. On Windows 7, this is the directory <code>C:\Users\AverageJoe\vimfiles</code></p></li>
<li><p>If the computer is on a Windows domain at work, the <code>$HOME</code> might be set to a shared folder. Access to this non-local directory might sometime be not possible or slow, causing problems if the user places ViM plugins in its vimfiles directory. A good replacement for the work domain is <code>$USERPROFILE</code>, which points to the local <code>C:\Users\AverageJoe</code> even on a domain. The user can set this up as his vimfiles directory by adding this line to his vimrc file:</p>
<pre><code>set runtimepath+=$USERPROFILE/vimfiles</code></pre></li>
</ul>
