<p>I picked up <a href="http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/"><strong>Computer
Systems: A Programmer’s Perspective</strong></a> (2nd Edition) by
<strong>Randal Bryant</strong> and <strong>David O’Hallaron</strong>
while searching for a stimulating book on computer architecture or
operating systems. CSAPP turned out to be a good find since it is aimed
at the intersection of computer architecture, computers systems and OS.
Using practical examples and problems the book walks the student through
all the hardware and software knowledge that is required to understand
how a program comes to life on a computer.</p>
<p>Assume a student compiles a <em>Hello world</em> program and runs it.
A plethora of hardware features and a large set of software come
together to make this simple magic possible. Software like compiler,
assembler, linker, loader, libraries and operating system kernel help to
compile and load the program. Hardware features like hard disk, main
memory, controllers, buses, cache and the processor bring the program to
life. Also, hardware and software need to also act in tandem in virtual
memory, system calls and interrupt handling to make the execution of a
program scalable, efficient, fast and safe. This book argues that a good
programmer needs to be aware of all the afore mentioned concepts and
these are what the book tries to cover.</p>
<p>Some notes about this book:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The book is structured as a workbook. You read a concept, solve a
problem or experiment with a program that illustrates it and then move
on to the next concept. There are trivia, blurbs and practical
information about IA32 (Intel) architecture and Linux where-ever
necessary. This ensures that the book remains grounded in reality and
never feels dry to study.</p></li>
<li><p>The authors have tried their best to introduce as many of modern
multiprocessor concepts as possible in a practical way. There is a lot
missing, for example, super-scalar architecture and out-of-order
execution. However, the programmer interested in these details can
easily learn about them with a book like <a
href="2011-12-11-inside-the-machine.html"><strong>Inside The
Machine</strong></a>.</p></li>
<li><p>The chapters on <strong>memory hierarchy</strong> and virtual
memory are the real treasure in this book. The sections on
<strong>cache</strong> here and in Inside The Machine stand head-to-head
as the most practical introductions to the topic.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Virtual memory</strong> is an important concept, but
sadly it gets short shrift in computer science education. This is
because it requires the OS and hardware to work together and those
subjects are typically covered by two different courses or textbooks in
university. Not having to deal with such caste boundaries, this book is
able to show the student how virtual memory is brought to life.</p></li>
<li><p>The book gets a bit vague towards the end. I was not interested
in and did not see any benefit for this book to touch on areas of system
I/O, network programming and concurrency.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I am happy to conclude that CSAPP is a stimulating book to study and
work through. This book covers all the knowledge that a good programmer
needs to understand how his program executes upon the OS and CPU and how
to make it efficient, fast and scalable. I highly recommend Computer
Systems: A Programmer’s Perspective for anyone who feel they need a
better grasp of these ideas.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/4</p>
