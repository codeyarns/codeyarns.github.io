<h1 class="title">How to fix an overheating Vostro 3300</h1>

<p>The <strong>Dell Vostro 3300</strong> laptop is now infamous for its terrible cooling design. The intake vent on the top-right bottom struggles to deliver air. The fan is noisy and still hopeless at cooling the CPU. I pulled out this old laptop recently and found that it would shut down due to CPU overheating. I fired up <a href="http://www.almico.com/speedfan.php"><strong>SpeedFan</strong></a> and sure enough, the CPU cores were 73C at idle! The only solution I could think of to give this laptop a longer life was to clean the fan and change the thermal paste.</p>
<p>Thanks to preparing well for this surgery, it went off well and the idle temperatures dropped by 15C! It still hits the 70s on a load, what a terrible cooling design! The temperature can be dropped by a further 5C by giving that top-right bottom vent a lot of space. This can be done for example by attaching high feet at the top row of the laptop.</p>
<h2 id="what">What</h2>
<p>Here are the things I found that I used:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Phillips screwdrivers</strong>: Unlike other laptops that use exotic screws, I found that Vostro 3300 uses only Phillips screws. See the screws visible at the bottom of the laptop for an example. You will need Phillips screwdrivers of a size that opens those and one more at the next smaller size (cause some of the internal screws are smaller).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Slot screwdriver</strong>: You will need one or two of these of the small size. There are some connectors and latches that really need a strong nudge to be opened. Due to the cramped space and tiny size, it is impossible to do this with your fingers. Alternatively, a small metal <strong>tweezers</strong> that is strong can also do the job.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Spudge</strong>: Entire sections of this laptop need this tool to be pried open. You could use a couple of tiny slot screwdrivers, but they are not as convenient as the spudge.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Brush</strong> or <strong>compressed air duster</strong>: To remove the dust stuck on the fan blades, heat sink and vents.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Thermal paste</strong>: Any good paste will do to replace the old one. I used the <strong>Arctic MX-4</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Something to clean the old thermal paste. Folks use cleaning alcohol and a soft non-abrasive cloth. I used an old thin sock.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how">How</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QNNBwdD0Uo">this video</a> that shows how to get the entire process done. It is actually quite fantastic to watch the person do it without breaking a sweat.</p></li>
<li><p>If you need more help, get the <strong>Vostro 3300 service manual</strong>, which can be found online. The manual has sections, each explaining how to remove a certain component. In order to get to the fan and CPU, you will need to remove the following components in order (the order differs a bit in the above video):</p></li>
</ul>
<p>** Base cover (page 2) ** Battery (page 4) ** Hard drive (page 23) ** Optical drive (page 41) ** WLAN card (page 67) ** Keyboard (page 29) ** WWAN card (page 71) -- my laptop does not have this ** Palm rest (page 43) ** System board (page 65) ** Heat sink and fan (page 26)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Once you get the fan and heat sink, clean them, apply the paste. Put back all the components in the reverse order.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Note:</strong> For each component, do a careful visual inspection to ensure everything blocking its removal has been pulled out. This is because, I found that the service manual misses a few cables and tabs that need to be pulled out.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This is the first time I disassembled a laptop down to the CPU. I found that it is quite doable if a service manual or a demo video is available. And having the required tools is crucial. Good luck if you planning to try the same! :-)</p>
