<h2 id="problem">Problem</h2>
<p>At 2PM today, I started noticing problems with my home wireless
network. All the devices connected wirelessly to the wireless router
started getting disconnected and reconnected repeatedly. Even when
connected for the brief period, the Internet speed was an order of
magnitude less than normal.</p>
<p>The wireless router is a D-Link DCM-604 cable wireless modem-router
provided by Starhub. There were two Android smartphones, an Aftershock
XG15 V2 notebook and a Macbook Air 2013 connected to the network which
experienced these problems.</p>
<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>
<p>I thought that this was a problem with the wireless router. But,
resetting the wireless router to factory settings did not help. I spent
a lot of time going through the settings of the router, hoping that
something had gone wrong with one of them. However, connecting to the
router using an Ethernet cable worked fine.</p>
<p>On mulling over this problem and its symptoms, I had no choice but to
settle on a crazy conclusion: one of the wireless devices was causing
this problem. I do not know how a wireless client could be continuously
messing with the wireless router, to the point that its affecting the
entire wireless network. But, I decided to test this.</p>
<p>To do that, I started by powering off the connected devices one by
one, restarting the wireless router each time and checking the status of
the wireless network. And soon I hit pay dirt: the Aftershock XG15
V2!</p>
<p>This notebook was using a Qualcomm Atheros AR9462 wireless network
adapter. I was running Ubuntu 14.04 with kernel 3.13.0.40-generic on it.
I do not know whether the hardware or the driver was causing this
problem and how. Turning off the wireless from Ubuntu tray icon did
nothing. But on restarting the device and then restarting the wireless
router, peace was restored. All the devices connected and worked
fine!</p>
<p><strong>Tried with:</strong> Aftershock XF15 V2 notebook, Qualcomm
Atheros AR9462 wireless network adapter, Ubuntu 14.04 and D-Link DCM-604
wireless router</p>
