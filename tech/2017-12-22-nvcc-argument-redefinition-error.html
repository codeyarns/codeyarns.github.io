<h2 id="problem">Problem</h2>
<p>I was trying to build a CUDA project that worked on one computer on a
second computer. Though this project built without problems on the first
computer, nvcc gave an argument redefinition error on the second
computer:</p>
<pre><code>nvcc fatal   : redefinition of argument &#39;std&#39;</code></pre>
<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>
<p>At first, I thought that the compilation error was arising from the
source code. Actually, the error is being reported about a compilation
argument to nvcc. It is saying that a std argument has been provided
more than once.</p>
<p>This project was using CMake, so the actual compilation commands
invoked by make are hidden. I used the VERBOSE trick, described <a
href="2013-10-07-how-to-view-commands-executed-by-make.html">here</a>,
to view the actual commands issued to the C++ and CUDA compilers. Not
surprisingly, I found that the <code>-std=c++11</code> argument was
being passed twice. But why? I checked the CMakeLists.txt file and found
that indeed the C++11 argument was being passed to the compiler twice by
setting it in both <code>CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS</code> and
<code>CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS</code>. How and why was this working fine on the
first computer? Turns out that the older CMake used on the first
computer would not pass the C++ flag to NVCC, so it had to be
specifically redefined for CUDA compiler flags.</p>
<p>The second computer was using a newer version of Ubuntu, with newer
version of CMake. This was intelligent enough to pass a C++ flag to the
CUDA NVCC compiler too. But since the NVCC flag of the same name also
existed, it was causing the argument redefinition error. Removing the
flag from the CUDA flags made the problem go away.</p>
