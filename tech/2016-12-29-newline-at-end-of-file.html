<p>Many Linux tools and compilers that process text files require the text <strong>file to end with a newline</strong>. This is simply because they are designed to process a series of lines, each ending with a newline. That means, the last line of the file should also end in a newline.</p>
<p>If the file does not end with a newline, then C++ compilers and other tools complain with errors such as <code>No newline at end of file</code>.</p>
<p>How do you end up with a file that does not end in newline? If you use tools that are written for other platforms like Windows or are cross-platform, those might not follow the rule of ending the last line with a newline. The latest culprit who I found doing this mistake was the <strong>Visual Studio Code</strong> editor. Editors like Vim, which come from a Unix heritage, just do not allow you to save without a newline.</p>
<p>In Visual Studio Code, I set the <code>files.insertFinalNewline</code> option to true to fix this mistake.</p>
