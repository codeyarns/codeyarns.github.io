<h1 id="problem">Problem</h1>
<p>I have <a href="2013/03/24/diodon-clipboard-manager-for-ubuntu/"><strong>Diodon</strong></a> working fine on a Ubuntu 14.04 computer. But, when I tried it on a Ubuntu 15.04 computer, it would not work. It is running, but nothing I copy is appearing in its clipboard, which remains empty!</p>
<h1 id="solution">Solution</h1>
<p>The newer version of Diodon now uses the <a href="http://zeitgeist-project.com/"><strong>Zeitgeist</strong></a> service for tracking what is copied by the user. This is described in <a href="https://esite.ch/2014/08/why-does-diodon-not-save-anything-to-the-clipboard-history/">this blog post</a>. I usually turn off all logging of file and application use on Ubuntu and this is nothing but the Zeitgeist service.</p>
<p>To minimally turn back Zeitgeist just enough for Diodon to work, go to System Settings -&gt; Security and Privacy -&gt; File and Applications. Turn ON the <strong>Record file and application usage</strong> option and include <strong>Documents</strong>. The rest can be disabled, they are not needed.</p>
<p>Restart Diodon and it should now work as expected.</p>
<p><strong>Tried with:</strong> Diodon 1.2.0 and Ubuntu 15.04</p>
