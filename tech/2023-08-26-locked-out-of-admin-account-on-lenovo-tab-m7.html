<h1 class="title">Locked out of admin account on Lenovo Tab M7</h1>

<p>One of the good features of the <a
href="2023-02-27-lenovo-tab-m7.html"><strong>Lenovo Tab M7
(Gen3)</strong></a> tablet is that it can be shared among many users.
The first account that is created is the <strong>admin</strong> or the
system user. Multiple other users can be added using the
<strong>Multiple users</strong> option in settings. However, it has a
fatal problem (as described below) that happened every time I used it -
so <strong>DO NOT USE THIS FEATURE</strong>, it is garbage!</p>
<h2 id="problem">Problem</h2>
<p>I had added an additional user to the tablet which had its own Google
account and apps. Switching between the admin user and the second user
was working fine for many days. However, one day while I was inside the
second user I could no longer go back to the admin user! The admin user
was present in the lock screen, but it was <em>greyed out</em>. Many
users have faced this problem as seen <a
href="https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Lenovo-Android-based-Tablets-and-Phablets/Lenovo-Tab-M7/m-p/5116502?page=1">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>One suggested solution is to download Android Platform Tools and
use the <code>adb</code> tool to debug and fix. However, USB debugging
should have been enabled on the tablet (before it went kaput) for this
to work. My tablet would not even be recognized as USB device when
plugged in, so it did not work.</p></li>
<li><p>Lenovo has a <a
href="https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/us/en/downloads/ds101291-rescue-and-smart-assistant-lmsa"><strong>Rescue
and Smart Assistant (RSA)</strong></a> tool that is supposed to work
with this tablet. But again, with the USB debugging not working, this
was not an option for me.</p></li>
<li><p>Thankfully, a <a
href="2023-08-26-how-to-factory-reset-lenovo-tab-m7.html">factory
reset</a> using the physical external buttons worked and I was able to
at least start from a fresh slate again.</p></li>
</ul>
