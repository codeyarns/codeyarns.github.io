<p>I have been using <a
href="index.html#foobar2000"><strong>Foobar2000</strong></a> to play
music on my computers for a long time now. It is fast, minimal and
functional, but I sometimes find its UI to be sterile and not fun.
Recently, I felt nostalgic for the fun times of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winamp"><strong>WinAmp</strong></a>
and started looking for modern clones of it. The best option I could
find was <a href="https://getwacup.com/"><strong>WACUP (WinAmp Community
Update Project)</strong></a>. (Terrible name, and apparently it is
pronounced <em>wakeup</em>.)</p>
<p>The software seems to be still in active development and only has
<em>preview</em> releases for public use and <em>beta</em> releases for
private testing. I went with the <em>Preview v1.0.21.7236</em> - the
download and installation were easy. I was able to invoke the player
from the Start menu by typing either <em>wacup</em> or
<em>winamp</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Skins:</strong> One of the main reasons to use WinAmp are
the skins. But I just needed a modern version of the classic skin that
would scale well on high resolution displays. And it looks like
<em>WinAmp Classic Modern</em> skin does that job.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Settings:</strong> There are a ton of settings and it
took a while to completely customize the player to my liking.
Especially, choosing the fonts for all part of the UI.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Once properly customized, WACUP seems to feel just like the classic
WinAmp, but updated for today. Though Preview, I have not seen any
problems in using the player over the past month regularly.</p>
