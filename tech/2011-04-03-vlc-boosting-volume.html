<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
<p>When watching videos, sometimes you wish the <strong>volume</strong> were a bit higher than the maximum your computer can play. The problem is especially acute with videos whose audio is actually pretty low or with the underpowered speakers of most laptops. By default, <strong>VLC</strong> can already boost the volume upto <strong>200%</strong>. But, what if you need your volume to be a big higher than that?</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>It is possible to squeeze out a bit more volume, at the expense of audio quality. In VLC, choose Tools â†’ <strong>Effects and Filters</strong> and in its Audio Effects tab you can see the Graphic Equalizer. Here you can get some volume boost by choosing to <strong>Enable</strong> it and dragging up the <strong>Preamp</strong> slider. You can get a further boost by dragging up all the individual sliders at the various frequencies.</p>
<p>If you want much more volume than this, you need some new speakers! :-)</p>
<p><strong>Tried with</strong>: VLC 1.1.3</p>
