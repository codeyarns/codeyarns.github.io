<p>I try to keep my <strong>Windows 7</strong> desktop as minimal as possible. One of the desktop elements I find unnecessary is the <strong>Clock</strong> which shows the time and date in the <strong>Notification</strong> area of the <strong>Taskbar</strong>. I check the time or date a few times in a day, but the clock sits in the Taskbar all day occupying a piece of the desktop and also a slice of my attention.</p>
<p><strong>Hiding the Clock</strong></p>
<p>Unlike normal icons in the Notification area, the Clock cannot be hidden so that it is still there, and can be seen by clicking to see the complete Notification area. The Clock is a System Icon that can be either on or completely hidden.</p>
<p>To hide the Clock, right-click on the Clock and choose <strong>Properties</strong>. This displays the <strong>Turn system icons on or off</strong> dialog. Choose Clock, choose Off and press OK. The clock is now gone from the Taskbar.</p>
<p><strong>Checking Time or Date</strong></p>
<p>You will need to check the time or date sometimes during the day. You can do that by invoking the <strong>Date and Time</strong> properties dialog. The most intuitive way to invoke it is to press the <strong>Win</strong> key and type <strong>Date</strong>, choose Date and Time and press Enter.</p>
<p>Another alternative is to create a shortcut for it and assign it a keyboard shortcut like <strong>Ctrl+Alt+d</strong>. The command to invoke this dialog is:</p>
<pre><code>RunDll32.exe shell32.dll,Control_RunDLL timedate.cpl</code></pre>
<p>The only limitation of hiding the Clock is that the calendar cannot be seen. I wish there was a shortcut to invoke that too.</p>
