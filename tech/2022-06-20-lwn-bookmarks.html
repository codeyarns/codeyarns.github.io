<p><a href="https://lwn.net/"><strong>Linux Weekly News (LWN)</strong></a> is a treasure trove of high-quality articles about the Linux kernel, C, Python, tools and Linux distributions. Collected below are my favorite articles from LWN:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://lwn.net/Kernel/Index/">LWN Index</a>: Index of all LWN topics and their articles.</li>
<li><a href="https://lwn.net/Calendar/">LWN Calendar</a>: Calendar of Linux conferences.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2022">2022</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/897435/">Vetting the cargo</a>: Mozilla introduces a cargo vetting process using audited package lists for Rust.</li>
<li><a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/896738/">Per-file OOM badness</a>: OOM killer will now also take into account the memory attached to files of a process, when choosing the victim process to kill.</li>
<li><a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/895587/">Improved error reporting in CPython 3.10 and later</a>: Possible thanks to its old LL1 parser replaced with a parsing expression parser.</li>
<li><a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/894598/">CXL 1: Management and tiering</a>: Compute eXpress Link is cache coherent interconnect for connecting CPU, RAM and accelerators (like GPU) between nodes. That is, you could have CPU-only node accessing its RAM from a RAM-only node through CXL.</li>
<li><a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/892080/">Super in Python Part 2</a>: Looks at super() call with 2 arguments and its complexities. Normal super() is equivalent to super(ThisClassName, self). super(X, self) takes MRO call chain of self and then fast forwards to after X and does calls.</li>
<li><a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/892755/">Risks of embedded bare repositories in Git</a>: Bare repositories embedded inside a normal repo is apparently a vector for user inadvertently running any random cmd. Article shows it with good example and commands. I don‚Äôt see why this bare repository feature is essential, just kill it.</li>
<li><a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/889171/">KOReader on Kobo review</a>: Seems like lots of features, but super slow.</li>
<li><a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/891398/">Super Python Part 1</a>: super() in multiple inheritance creates a MRO (Method Resolution Order) chain in topological order (C3 linearization) and follows those calls. This is confusing because in a diamond example, super() calls in Bottom, will call Left-&gt;Right-&gt;Top, while you normally expect Left-&gt;Top.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2021">2021</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/860389/">Features in Python 3.10</a>: switch-case, improved type hinting and user-friendly error reporting.</li>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/764647/">Feedforward network to classify bugfix patches</a>: Feedforward neural networks with three layers: input, hidden, and output. The layer organization is a way of describing the formula for making the decision; there are weights associated with each of the steps in the paths through the network. But where do those weights come from? The weights come from the training process. Data that has results with expected values can be used to ‚Äúback-propagate‚Äù weights in order to tune the model. Training is a process of ‚Äúmoving in some direction in our weight space‚Äù to produce better results, Lawall said. It is a hill-climbing problem where each iteration tries to improve on the last. At some point, she said, you decide that the error is small enough and stop. Their network is called PatchNet.</li>
<li><a href="https://lwn.net/ml/ksummit-discuss/CAKMK7uE535-7Vs9EAa2725XL2TX2ChJCN0Zb3YaMe=MarYJOyw@mail.gmail.com/">Make CI as addictive as a slot machine</a>: ‚ÄúBut the trick in making CI really effective is to make it about as addictive as a slot machine. Instant gratification and quick results is absolutely key, and developers want to watch it do its things. The more you can give them that, the more your developers will care about CI results (the green checkmark quickly starts to look like candy in your eyes), and the less maintainers have to check this themselves.‚Äù</li>
<li><a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/751763/">Terminal emulator comparison by LWN</a>: Comparison based on latency, scroll speed and resource usage. Xterm has low latency, but slow speed. Urxvt has speed, but bad latency.</li>
<li><a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/750306/">Macro to check if input is an ICE (integer constant expression)</a>: See in LWN article. <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/3/20/845">Linus Torvalds explaining how it works</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2017">2017</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/725508/">Memory use of CPython and MicroPython</a>: Also see these <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/kavya719/the-memory-chronicles">slides</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/715090/">Case against password hashers</a>: LessPass seems to have more features than SuperGenPass. Might have to switch.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2013">2013</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/576276/">BTRFS filesystem</a>: B-tree filesystem. ext2 keeps pointers to individual disc blocks. This means the metadata is quite huge since files have been getting bigger. In constrast, (ext4 and) BTRFS keeps pointers to extends: a set of contiguous blocks. COW (Copy on write): Changed blocks are written elsewhere, so older blocks are still kept on disk (until garbage collected when disc gets full). Thanks to COW, no journal is needed (like ext4). So recovery from crash is easy. COW also enables easy snapshots of files (or history). FS can also span across disks and volumes. Checksums for data and metadata to catch any disk error.</li>
<li><a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/568169/">Free drivers for ARM graphics</a></li>
