<h1 id="problem">Problem</h1>
<p>I switched from <strong>Unity</strong> to <strong>XFCE</strong> by installing <strong>Xubuntu</strong>. The <strong>indicator plugin</strong> area from the Panel in Unity also appears in the XFCE Panel. Whenever I opened Firefox, I noticed that its entire <strong>menu bar</strong> would appear in the middle of this indicator area!</p>
<h1 id="solution">Solution</h1>
<p>The easy solution is to <strong>remove</strong> the indicator plugin area from the XFCE Panel. However, I have some Unity indicators that I need to be displayed in the XFCE Panel, like the Dropbox client for example.</p>
<p>A better solution is to remove the <strong>Application Menu</strong> indicator itself. This is what is used by Unity to display the menu bar of an application in the Unity Panel.</p>
<p>I do not need this on XFCE since it shows the menu bar in the application itself. Removing this indicator is easy:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo apt remove indicator-appmenu</code></pre>
<p>Restart Ubuntu to get XFCE Panel in the correct state.</p>
<p><strong>Tried with:</strong> XFCE 4.12 and Ubuntu 15.04</p>
