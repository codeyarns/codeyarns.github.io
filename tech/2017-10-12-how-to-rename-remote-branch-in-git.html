<p><strong>Git</strong> is known for its confusing and difficult commands. If you want to rename a remote branch, say a branch that is on Github, from the comfort of your shell then you are in luck for one such experience! :-)</p>
<p>This is the invocation to rename a branch <code>old_branch</code> on a remote named <code>foo_remote</code> to a new branch name <code>new_branch</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ git push foo_remote foo_remote/old_branch:refs/heads/new_branch :old_branch</code></pre>
<p>If you find yourself renaming remote branches a lot, then it is better to add this as a Git command. To do that, save this piece of shell script code as a file named <code>git-rename-remote-branch</code>:</p>
<p>https://gist.github.com/ashwin/63aa43d6e74f5969f7620f2b3a1981e1</p>
<p>The file can be named anything as long as it begins with a <code>git-</code> prefix. Make it executable and place it in any directory that is in your <code>PATH</code>.</p>
<p>Now, you can rename a remote branch with a sane command:</p>
<pre><code>$ git rename-remote-branch foo_remote old_branch new_branch</code></pre>
<p><strong>Tried with:</strong> Git 2.7.4 and Ubuntu 14.04</p>
