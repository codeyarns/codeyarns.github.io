<h1 id="problem">Problem</h1>
<p>I was using the simple <code>rand</code> API provided by C for generating random numbers. I needed to generate <code>m</code> sequences of <code>n</code> numbers each. To my surprise, I found that two of these sequences were exactly the same!</p>
<h1 id="solution">Solution</h1>
<p>I was using <code>srand</code> to seed the generation of each sequence. In the release version of my code, I was seeding it using <code>time</code>, which is a common practice:</p>
<pre><code>srand((unsigned int) time(nullptr));</code></pre>
<p>When I needed to debug the code, I needed the sequences to be reproducible, so I seeded them as:</p>
<pre><code>// m sequences of n random numbers
for (int i = 0; i &lt; m; ++i)
{
    srand(i);
    for (int j = 0; j &lt; n; ++j)
        // Use rand() here
}</code></pre>
<p>On closer observation, the sequences produced by <code>srand(0)</code> and <code>srand(1)</code> were exactly same!</p>
<p>This was surprising behavior. The <code>srand</code> man page had no information about this. It only warned that if no seed was provided, <code>1</code> would be assumed as seed:</p>
<pre><code>If no seed value is provided, the rand() function is automatically seeded with a value of 1.</code></pre>
<p>The problem was found by looking in the source code of <strong>GNU Libc</strong>. In the implementation of <code>srand</code> in the file <code>stdlib/random_r.c</code> lies <a href="https://github.com/lattera/glibc/blob/master/stdlib/random_r.c#L179">this gem</a>:</p>
<pre><code>/* We must make sure the seed is not 0.  Take arbitrarily 1 in this case.  */
if (seed == 0)
  seed = 1;</code></pre>
<p>You have got to love open source! So, seed of <code>0</code> is internally reset to <code>1</code> in the glibc implementation of <code>srand</code>!</p>
<p>So, beware of the seed you pass to <code>srand</code>. It might be wise to make sure that neither <code>0</code> or <code>1</code> is used as seed on Linux.</p>
<p><strong>Tried with:</strong> GLibc 2.19.1 and Ubuntu 14.04</p>
