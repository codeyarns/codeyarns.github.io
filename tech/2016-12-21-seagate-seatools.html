<p><strong>Seatools</strong> is a tool that can be used to test and diagnose internal and external harddisks manufactured by <strong>Seagate</strong>. It can be installed and used on Windows. There does not appear to be a Linux version available.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Seatools can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.seagate.com/support/downloads/seatools/">here</a> and installed easily on Windows.</p></li>
<li><p>Connect the harddisk you want to diagnose and then run Seatools. If you cannot find it in the Start menu, just check <code>C:\Program Files (x86)\Seagate\Seatools for Windows</code> for an executable to run.</p></li>
<li><p>When it starts it takes a lot of time looking for ATA, SCSI and USB drives connected to your computer.</p></li>
<li><p>After it starts, it shows the drives it has detected. For my external USB drive, it showed up both as the external USB drive and as an internal drive. I guess this external drive was actually created from an older internal drive series or something like that.</p></li>
<li><p>Select the drive and choose from the above menu to get its information or run short tests. My drive failed in the short test itself.</p></li>
<li><p>If the drive fails any test, it is probably unrepairable and needs to be returned (if under warranty) for a replacement or just discarded. Seatools allows you to enter the Serial and Product numbers and checks if the drive is in warranty for you.</p></li>
<li><p>From the Seagate website you can create a return order which Seagate calls RMA and then return the device using the order and labels it provides.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tried with:</strong> Seagate Backup Plus Portable Drive 1TB</p>
