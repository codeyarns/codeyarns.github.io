<h1 class="title">GParted block size warning</h1>

<h2 id="problem">Problem</h2>
<p>I opened <strong>GParted</strong> to look at the partition information of my drives. It popped up this strange warning:</p>
<pre><code>The driver descriptor says the physical block size is 2048 bytes, but Linux says it is 512 bytes</code></pre>
<p>I figured out that this error was about a USB thumb drive that was plugged into my computer. That USB drive was working fine and I could mount and read its files. So, what is this warning and how to fix it?</p>
<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>
<p>Turns out that the <strong>block size</strong> for this drive was set to 2048 bytes. It should have been 512 bytes. Its disk size was also appearing 4 times larger in GParted!</p>
<p>On thinking further about this, I remembered that this drive had been formatted as a bootable media to install Ubuntu using GNOME Disks as described <a href="https://codeyarns.com/2016/07/07/how-to-make-ubuntu-usb-flash-drive-using-disk-image-writer/">here</a>. That disk writer must have erroneously set the block size of this drive as 2048 bytes.</p>
<p>Changing back the block size to 512 was easy:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdc bs=2048 count=1</code></pre>
<p>Replace <code>/dev/sdc</code> with the device ID for your USB thumb drive. <strong>Note that this command completely destroys all your data on the drive.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tried with:</strong> Ubuntu 16.04</p>
