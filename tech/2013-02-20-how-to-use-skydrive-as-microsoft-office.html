<p><a href="http://skydrive.com"><strong>SkyDrive</strong></a> offers a lot of online storage that can be synced with many devices. However, its killer feature is that you can create, edit and view <strong>Microsoft Office</strong> documents, right in the comfort of your browser.</p>
<p>SkyDrive will render almost any <strong>Word</strong>, <strong>Excel</strong> and <strong>Powerpoint</strong> file, no matter how complicated it is. Just upload it to SkyDrive and view it from there. If you use <strong><a href="http://outlook.com">Outlook.com</a></strong> for webmail, you can view Word, Excel and Powerpoint attachments in SkyDrive.</p>
<p>In addition to viewers, SkyDrive also has Word, Excel and Powerpoint <strong>webapps</strong>. So, you can create and edit such files right in your browser. Of course, these webapps have only the basic features, since Microsoft does not want to kill its golden goose: Microsoft Office. However, these webapps are already on par or even better than <strong>Google Docs</strong>.</p>
<p>SkyDrive is a boon only for those who do not want to pay for Microsoft Office, but also for folks on Linux. With SkyDrive, Linux users can view, create and edit Office files better than what you did with LibreOffice.</p>
<p>So, in essence SkyDrive is a web-based Microsoft Office Lite. Enjoy it :-)</p>
