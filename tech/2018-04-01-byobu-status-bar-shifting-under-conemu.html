<h1 id="problem">Problem</h1>
<p>I installed the latest stable release of <strong>ConEmu</strong>. I opened a Cygwin shell and used SSH to connect to a remote computer. I ran <strong>Byobu</strong> on the remote computer. I noticed that its status bar would shift upward, overwriting the entire screen after some time.</p>
<h1 id="solution">Solution</h1>
<p>This problem is documented <a href="https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues/1187">here</a>. The solution suggested by the ConEmu creator is to use the <strong>ConEmu/msys terminal connector</strong> plugin. Using this connector is however a bit complicated. But, according to this <a href="https://conemu.github.io/blog/2017/07/05/Build-170705.html">post</a>, it has been rolled into ConEmu starting with the 170705 release. I checked and found that the stable release I had installed was 161206. The stable release was years behind!</p>
<p>Seeing no recent stable version available, I opted to download a <strong>preview</strong> release from <a href="https://www.fosshub.com/ConEmu.html">here</a>. This release was dated later than 170705. byobu worked fine through SSH from Cygwin after that!</p>
