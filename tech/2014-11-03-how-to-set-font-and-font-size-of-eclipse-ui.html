<p>The <strong>font</strong>, <strong>font size</strong> and <strong>colors</strong> of most of the UI elements of <strong>Eclipse</strong> can be changed. Some of them can be set from inside Eclipse, others can be set in the <strong>CSS</strong> files used by the current Eclipse theme. There are other elements which can be changed only by modifying the settings of the current GTK or GNOME theme.</p>
<h1 id="inside-eclipse">Inside Eclipse</h1>
<p>Based on the current theme that Eclipse is using, many of the settings are in <strong>CSS</strong> files.</p>
<ul>
<li>Font and fonts sizes of editor, console, dialog and other UI elements can be changed from Window -&gt; Preferences -&gt; General -&gt; Appearance -&gt; Colors and Fonts.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, you will find that the font and font sizes of <strong>Project Explorer</strong>, <strong>Outline</strong>, <strong>Problems</strong>, Make and many other UI windows which hold tree-like elements cannot be changed from here. To do that you need to modify the CSS file of the theme you are current using. Here is how to do that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Find out what is the current theme that Eclipse is using. You can see that in Window -&gt; Preferences -&gt; General -&gt; Appearance. For example, I found that mine was using the theme <strong>GTK</strong> and the Color and Font theme was <strong>Default</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Go to the install directory of Eclipse and go to the themes CSS directory. For example, on my system this was <code>plugins/org.eclipse.ui.themes_1.0.1.v20140819-1717/css</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Open the CSS file that corresponds to the theme that Eclipse is currently using. For example, for my theme I found the file <code>e4_default_gtk.css</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Add this CSS style to change the font and font size. For example, to set to font Arial with size 8, I would add:</p></li>
</ul>
<pre><code>.MPart Tree {
    font-family: Consolas;
    font-size: 8;
}</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Close the file. Close Eclipse and open it back again. You should be able to see the change in Project Explorer, Outline, and other windows that have tree-like UI elements.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><p>Use the <a href="2015/01/30/gnome-tweak-tool/"><strong>GNOME Tweak Tool</strong></a> to set the font and font sizes.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the <a href="2015/01/30/gnome-color-chooser/"><strong>GNOME Color Chooser</strong></a> to set the foreground and background colors of these UI elements.</p></li>
</ul>
