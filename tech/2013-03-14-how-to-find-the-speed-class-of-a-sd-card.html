<p><strong>SD cards</strong> are designated with different <strong>speed classes</strong> based on the read and write speeds they can deliver. Typically, the speed class of a SD card is printed on the exterior of the card. To find out the speed class, look for the <strong>speed class symbol</strong> on your SD card as shown <a href="https://www.sdcard.org/consumers/speed/speed_class/">here</a>.</p>
<p>If your SD card does not have any speed class symbol printed on it, do not despair. Plug in your card and figure out the read and write speed of the card as explained <a href="2013/03/14/how-to-find-read-and-write-speed-of-any-storage-device-in-ubuntu/">here</a>. Then compare the write speed with the minimum write speed guaranteed by different speed classes as shown in the table <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Digital#Speeds">here</a>. This is pretty easy to remember: a <strong>class 2</strong> device promises a write speed of at least 2 MB/sec, a <strong>class 4</strong> device promises a write speed of at least 4 MB/sec and so on.</p>
<p><strong>Tried with:</strong> Ubuntu 12.04 LTS</p>
