<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bubblesoft.android.bubbleupnp&amp;hl=en"><strong>BubbleUPnP UPnP/DLNA</strong></a> seems to be most popular UPnP/DLNA server and client for Android. It can both serve the content on your Android device to your home network or receive media streams from a UPnP/DLNA server on your home network.</p>
<p>I used it as a UPnP/DLNA client to receive music and videos from a <strong>MiniDLNA</strong> server on the home network. The videos play fine through an external player. Music files in a folder can be added to a playlist for ordered or shuffled play. However, in the free version only 16 music files can be played back in this way. That is a big disadvantage if you are not willing to pay for this app.</p>
<p><strong>Tried with:</strong> BubbleUPnP UPnP/DLNA 2.3, Android 5.0.2 and Nexus 7 (2013)</p>
