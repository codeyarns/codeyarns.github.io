<p>Video files that are on partitions accessible by <strong>Raspbian</strong> can be played using <strong>OMXPlayer</strong>. However, it is quite a hassle to <strong>SSH</strong> into your <strong>Raspberry Pi</strong> and play a movie using OMX Player from the shell. The ideal solution would be to browse the video files from the comfort of your Android device and play it from there. And that is exactly what <strong>OMX Remote</strong> does!</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>HDMI</strong>: Connect your Pi to your TV using a HDMI cable.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>SSH</strong>: Make sure you can SSH into your Raspberry Pi from a computer on your home network.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>OMXPlayer</strong>: After SSH into the Pi, make sure you can play videos from the shell using OMXPlayer as described <a href="https://codeyarns.com/2016/03/20/omxplayer/">here</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Install OMX Remote</strong>: It can be installed from the Play Store <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tencarssoftware.omxremote&amp;hl=en">here</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Configure OMX Remote</strong>: Provide the hostname (or IP address of your Pi), port (usually 22), username (usually pi) and password. I also like to set the root directory of my media.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Play using remote</strong>: Browse the video files from the app and click on a video file to play it on your TV. Various remote control UIs of varying complexity are available by swiping left and right. Some of the useful buttons on the remote control is to switch audio channels (speaker with arrow buttons) and to switch subtitles (speech bubble with arrow buttons).</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tried with:</strong> OMX Remote 1.9</p>
