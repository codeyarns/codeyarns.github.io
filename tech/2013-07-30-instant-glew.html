<p>I have written a small book titled <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/how-to-deploy-opengl-extensions-using-glew/book"><strong>Instant GLEW</strong></a> about deploying <strong>OpenGL extensions</strong> in graphics programs by using the <a href="http://glew.sourceforge.net/"><strong>GLEW</strong></a> library. The book is published by <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/"><strong>PacktPub</strong></a> and is available from 26 July 2013. It is available in both print and ebook formats. The book is available at <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/how-to-deploy-opengl-extensions-using-glew/book"><strong>PacktPub</strong></a>,Â <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1783280476/"><strong>Amazon</strong></a>, <a href="http://my.safaribooksonline.com/book/programming/opengl/9781783280476"><strong>Safari</strong></a>, <a href="http://www.kobobooks.com/ebook/Instant-GLEW/book-uwb7e8wDsUmS5UrvXvMxfw/page1.html"><strong>Kobo</strong></a> and <a href="http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/BookDetailsPL?bi=10772622384"><strong>AbeBooks</strong></a>. You can rate and review it at <strong><a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18244406-instant-glew">Goodreads</a></strong>. Get this book if you are taking your first steps with using OpenGL extensions in your programs.</p>
<p>GLEW is a pretty simple library to use, but students who are studying computer graphics for the first time have a hard time using OpenGL and OpenGL extensions. This problem is all the more exacerbated by the archaic versions of OpenGL that ship with the various versions of <strong>Windows</strong>. Programmers are forced to use OpenGL extensions for features that are considered basic and essential in graphics programs. This is the problem that GLEW attacks successfully.</p>
<p>In the book, I explain how to <strong>install</strong> the GLEW library on Windows and <strong>customize</strong> your Visual Studio solution to use it for compiling and linking your programs. I illustrate the usage of GLEW by using it to apply vertex and fragment <strong>shader</strong> programs on a teapot in 3D. Using shaders in an OpenGL program is probably the most popular use of OpenGL extensions and that is the reason I picked this example. You do not need to know GLSL or shader programming to understand this example.</p>
<p>In later sections of the book, I explain the other useful APIs of GLEW which help you write clean and portable programs that can fallback on older rendering techniques when advanced methods are not available. I also introduce a few useful <strong>utilities</strong> that make using OpenGL extensions informative and fun. Finally, there might be times when you need to access a bleeding-edge OpenGL extension that is not yet supported in GLEW. I show how to use such a new extension in your programs. It can get messy, but I show you how to get it done.</p>
<p>All said, this tiny book should be useful to students and programmers to quickly start using GLEW in their programs. If you find yourself using OpenGL extensions, do try <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/how-to-deploy-opengl-extensions-using-glew/book">Instant GLEW</a>! :-)</p>
