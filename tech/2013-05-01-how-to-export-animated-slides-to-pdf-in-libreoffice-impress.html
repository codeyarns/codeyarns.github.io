<p><strong>LibreOffice Impress</strong> has a useful feature to <strong>export</strong> the slides of a presentation to <strong>PDF</strong>. However, if you have animated images in your slides, these animations are not exported to PDF. This is partly because most types of animations cannot be rendered in PDF as pages. However, the most common animation is for images to <strong>appear</strong> or <strong>disappear</strong> on mouse click. It should be possible to support these animations in PDF.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/monperrus/ExpandAnimations"><strong>ExpandAnimations</strong></a> extension can be used to export the appear-disappear animations in a LibreOffice Impress presentation to PDF. The download link for the <strong>oxt</strong> extension file can be found at its <a href="https://github.com/monperrus/ExpandAnimations">Github page</a>. Double-click the file to install the extension using LibreOffice. Once installed, you can export any presentation open in Impress by using Tools &gt; Add-ons &gt; Expand animations</p>
<p><strong>Tried with:</strong> ExpandAnimations 0.2, LibreOffice 3.5.7.2 and Ubuntu 12.04 LTS</p>
