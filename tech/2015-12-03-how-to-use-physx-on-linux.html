<p><strong>PhysX</strong> is a 3D game physics engine provided by <strong>NVIDIA</strong>. They have released the source code of the engine on <strong>Github</strong>, though with restricted access. This library and its sample programs can be compiled from source easily.</p>
<p>Here are my notes on how to compile this library, run its sample tools and get started:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You need a Linux computer (I use Ubuntu), with a fairly modern NVIDIA graphics card.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure you have installed recent NVIDIA graphics drivers and a recent version of CUDA on it. Ensure that these are working correctly before trying PhysX.</p></li>
<li><p>Go to <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/physx-source-github">this webpage</a> and jump through their hoops to get access to the PhysX Github page. Essentially, NVIDIA requires you to create a login with them and after that they give your Github login the access to their PhysX source code.</p></li>
<li><p>Once you have access to PhysX source code, clone its repository to your computer:</p></li>
</ul>
<pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/PhysX-3.3.git</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><p>The documentation in the source code is outdated and is misleading. This is how the source code is laid out: <code>Source</code> for source code, <code>Snippets</code> and <code>Samples</code> have small programs to try PhysX. Once you have compiled these Snippets and Samples, their binaries will be placed in <code>Bin/linux64</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Each of the above three code directories has a <code>compiler/linux64</code> directory which holds the Makefiles to build them. There are four build profiles available: <code>release</code>, <code>profile</code>, <code>checked</code> and <code>debug</code>. Just invoking <code>make</code> builds all four versions. To build just the release versions, I did <code>make release</code> in all the three code directories.</p></li>
<li><p>Once the library and its snippets and samples are built, you can try these programs from <code>Bin/linux64</code>. For example, the <code>samples</code> program allows you try many of the features of the engine in an interactive GUI.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tried with:</strong> PhysX 3.3.4, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 750 Ti and Ubuntu 14.04</p>
