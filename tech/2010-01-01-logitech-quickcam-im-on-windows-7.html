<p>At work I use a <strong>Logitech Quickcam IM</strong> (Model Number:
<em>V-UBB39</em>) webcamera bought in 2006. After I installed Windows 7,
I needed to reinstall the drivers for this webcam. I could not find the
installation CD of this webcam. (Who keeps around installation discs in
this age anyway?) Checking the Logitech website for drivers, I was
surprised to see that this webcam is no longer supported! However, the
<strong><a
href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/">Windows
7 Compatibility Center</a></strong> listed the Quickcam IM as <a
href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Details.aspx?type=Hardware&amp;p=Logitech%20Quickcam%20IM%20Webcam&amp;v=Logitech&amp;uid=961361-0403&amp;pf=2&amp;pi=9&amp;s=quickcam&amp;os=32-bit">compatible</a>.
Surely they must have used some driver to check the compatibility!</p>
<p>Google led me to some shady looking websites offering the old drivers
(Quickcam 8.x) which supposedly are meant for this webcam. I tried to
install them and they did not work. My suspicion is that they are meant
for Windows XP and would not work on Windows 7 due to the large changes
in the driver model starting from Vista. I needed a driver written for
Vista or later for the Quickcam.</p>
<p>Giving up on finding the Windows 7 drivers for Quickcam IM, I decided
to install the drivers of <strong><a
href="http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/435/4260&amp;hub=1&amp;cl=sg,en">Logitech
Quickcam Connect</a></strong>, since it <em>looked</em> the most similar
to my webcam. Windows 7 warned me that there are problems with Windows 7
and Quickcam drivers! I continued, the installation went through but
failed when I plugged in the webcam! The error dialog mentioned that one
of the reasons for this could be due to installation by a
<strong>non-Administrator</strong>. I had installed by elevating from a
Standard User to Administrator. Ideally, this should work, but looks
like the Quickcam developers have not put in enough effort to make this
work. Sighing, I un-installed the drivers and installed again after
explicitly logging into an <strong>Administrator</strong> account. The
<em>Quickcam IM</em> webcam works now with Windows 7.</p>
<p>The webcam works, but the 3 years of experience with Logitech webcams
has left a bad taste in my mouth. Quickcam drivers and software have
always given me problems, both on Windows XP and now on Windows 7.
Fixing these issues have always involved multiple trials, reboots and
lots of wasted time. I really do not see why their webcams cannot
function without their drivers as a <strong>generic USB webcam
device</strong> to Windows, which many cheap webcams can!</p>
