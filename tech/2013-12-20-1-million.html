<p>I am happy to see that this blog has now crossed 1 million views. It has taken 4 years and 4 months to get here. This Wordpress blog was started in September 2009 after reading a blog post somewhere about how it is useful to spend the time to record information that you feel you might need in the future.</p>
<p>Thanks to being hosted at Wordpress.com, I never had to spend more than a few minutes per year on the maintenance of the blog. In December 2012, I decided to give the blog its own domain name. I expected its cost to be funded by WordAds and that tiny revenue has indeed been enough for that purpose. So, the blog now pays for itself.</p>
<p>At the time of this writing, ChooruCode has 1055 posts, 1406 comments and 1,000,153 views. On average, ~20 posts are written a month and the blog gets ~40,000 views in a month. The blog has been visited from 209 countries. The top 5 have been USA, Germany, UK, Canada and India. Almost all the traffic comes through Google search results.</p>
<p>The growth in views has been linear and has now plateaued. It will be interesting to see how many years it takes to hit the next million. Aloha :-)</p>
