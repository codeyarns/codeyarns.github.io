<p><strong>Vim</strong> can be used as a <strong>diff</strong> and <strong>merge</strong> tool. While it cannot match the beauty and power of GUI programs like <strong>Meld</strong>, it is immensely useful to diff and merge over a SSH session.</p>
<ul>
<li>Vim can be invoked in diff mode either using <code>vim -d</code> or as <code>vimdiff</code>. Just pass in the names of the files to compare:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>$ vimdiff 1.cpp 2.cpp
$ vim -d 1.cpp 2.cpp 3.cpp</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><p>Vim in diff mode displays each file in its own window side-by-side showing the diff sections in colors. You can switch between the windows using the normal Vim commands. (I use <code>Ctrl-W-W</code>.) And when you scroll down all the windows scroll down with you because they are locked to each other.</p></li>
<li><p>To switch to and fro between diffs use the <code>]-c</code> and <code>[-c</code> commands.</p></li>
<li><p>To put the diff the cursor is resting on to the next window use the command <code>dp</code></p></li>
<li><p>To pull the diff from the next window use the command <code>do</code></p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tried with:</strong> Vim 7.4 and Ubuntu 16.04</p>
