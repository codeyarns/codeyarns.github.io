<h1 class="title">Online computer stores in Singapore</h1>

<p>Unlike in USA, there is a paucity of online websites to find and buy computers in Singapore. I need to buy a smartphone, tablet or notebook for some family member or the other every few months. I find that most of the websites are just useless for this purpose. This is surprising since the brick-and-mortar stores are full of all sorts of esoteric models, prices and deals. But, no one webstore seems to have captured this scale of products.</p>
<p>The features I look for in such websites is that it should list almost all of the notebook models. Desktop computers, tablets and smartphones if listed is a plus. It should most definitely list the price and it will be great to have a look at special deals. I should be able to order online and have the notebook delivered home with no extra shipping cost or at least a reasonable cost.</p>
<h2 id="general-online-stores">General online stores</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.expansys.com.sg/">Expansys</a>: Seems to have a good selection of smartphones and tablets. Also, not as pricey as The Open Surface.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.theopensurface.com/">The Open Surface</a>: This Singapore based online store is aimed at folks who want to buy smartphones, tablets and gadgets which are available in US, but not available in Singapore. They are quite overpriced though.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.pricepanda.com.sg/computers/">PricePanda</a>: Has a large collection of notebooks, computers, hardware and gadgets. Thankfully it lists quite some details on each product and the price.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://dx.com">Deal Extreme</a>: Great selection of computer accessories. Shipping is free to Singapore.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://amazon.com/">Amazon USA</a>: If you buy more than $125, you get free shipping to Singapore. However, a lot of the listed items will ship only within USA, so you might have to use a shipping service (see below) to get it to Singapore.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.ebay.com.sg/">eBay</a>: Great place to look for peripherals and small items like cases or spare parts. Make sure to pick a seller close by (so that shipping charge is less) and check his reputation.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.courts.com.sg/Products/CID-54(Courts)/Computers">Courts</a>: A good sized collection with price and specification details.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="brand-specific-online-stores">Brand specific online stores</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.dell.com.sg/">Dell Singapore</a>: Dell has the best online store among the lot of manufacturers. In fact, their brick-and-mortar stores are just for viewing and all the sales are placed using this very website. If you watch for a few weeks, you are sure to come across some sweet deals which reduce the price by $100 or you get $100 worth of extra RAM or upsized CPU. Their work notebook section used to be a good place to order cheap notebooks (Vostro and such), but surprisingly they seem to no longer show the prices in that section of the website!</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.lenovo.com/sg/en/">Lenovo Singapore</a>: The computers are listed, but no price shown. Useless in my book.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.acer.com.sg/">Acer Singapore</a>: Useless website. You can find hundreds of their models in brick-and-mortar stores and exactly THREE notebooks on their website.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.asus.com/sg/">ASUS Singapore</a>: Website does not even load!</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="shipping-services">Shipping services</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.borderlinx.com/">BorderLinx</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.comgateway.com/">ComGateway</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.vpost.com.sg/">vPost</a>: Refuses to ship a lot of big brand items.</p></li>
</ul>
