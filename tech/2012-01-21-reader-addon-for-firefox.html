<p>I find that the form and layout of content in most webpages is detrimental to a distraction-free reading. Bad fonts are used and the content is squeezed in between photos, advertisements and links to other articles. So, for quite sometime now I have been using bookmarklets in Firefox that rendered the text content of a webpage in a distraction-free form for reading. At first I was using <a href="http://www.readability.com/"><strong>Readability</strong></a> and when it felt slow I switched to <strong>Readable</strong>. The latter has recently been bought by <strong>Evernote</strong> and has been repackaged as <a href="http://www.evernote.com/clearly/"><strong>Evernote Clearly</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Both of the above solutions are fine, except that they both have a bit of latency when applied on a webpage. Thankfully, there are now Firefox addons that provide this same feature and I have been happy with one of them: <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/reader/"><strong>Reader</strong></a>. This is based on Readable, and is much faster in rendering the content of a webpage. It uses a convenient shortcut too: <code>Ctrl + Alt + R</code>, R is for reading! To change the font, background color and other properties of its content display, just click its icon in the addon bar at the bottom of Firefox.</p>
<p><strong>Tried with:</strong> Reader 2.1 and Firefox 9.0</p>
