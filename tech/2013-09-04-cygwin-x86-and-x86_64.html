<h1 class="title">Cygwin x86 and x86_64</h1>

<p>I had a <a href="http://cygwin.com/"><strong>Cygwin</strong></a> installation on Windows x64. Recently, I found that its setup program could not pull the package list, claiming that the mirrors could not be found. It turns out that now Cygwin has <a href="http://cygwin.com/install.html">split off</a> into <strong>x86</strong> (for 32-bit Windows) and <strong>x86_64</strong> (for 64-bit Windows).</p>
<p>I tried the x86_64 and found it lacking many packages that are present in the x86 branch. In addition, there were many other problems too. So, if you are using a production system based on 64-bit Windows, you might still want to use the x86 Cygwin. Both of them work on 64-bit Windows, but the x86 version is bound to have fewer problems in the near future, until x86_64 version gains stability.</p>
