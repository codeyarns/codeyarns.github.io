<p>There are free over-the-air TV channels available in most places in
the US. I researched the channels in my region on the FCC’s <a
href="https://www.fcc.gov/media/engineering/dtvmaps"><strong>DTV
Reception Maps</strong></a> website. I also read the basics of such
antennas on the Wirecutter’s <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-indoor-hdtv-antenna/">indoor
HDTV antenna</a> page. After looking at the options, I got the <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IF70QCW"><strong>Amplified HD Digital
TV Antenna</strong></a>, primarily because it came with an optional
amplifier.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Installation is easy: using the provided stickers I stuck the
antenna on the wall near the TV. I had checked earlier that this
position was enough to get most of the channels available in my region.
The long cable allows you to even place the antenna much further away
from the TV, near or outside a window.</p></li>
<li><p>I had bought this particular antenna because it had a signal
booster amplifier. However, after seeing that the antenna itself was
sufficient, I did not use it.</p></li>
<li><p>Doing a channel scan on my TV was enough to tune all the
available channels.</p></li>
<li><p>Many of the channels turned out to be HD - great picture and
audio quality. The channels appeared in the TV with the channel name,
channel information, and information on what programs were
airing.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For folks who don’t get the cable packages and rely on digital
streaming services like Netflix, an antenna like this is a great way to
watch free local channels.</p>
