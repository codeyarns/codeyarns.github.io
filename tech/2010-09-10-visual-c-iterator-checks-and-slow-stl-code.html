<h1 class="title">Visual C++: Iterator Checks and Slow STL Code</h1>

<p>Visual C++ turns on a lot of <strong>checking</strong> on <strong>STL
iterators</strong> when compiled in <strong>Debug</strong> mode. This is
very helpful since any mistake with an iterator leads immediately to an
exception with a helpful exception message. This can catch latent bugs
much much earlier while programming.</p>
<p>However, this huge amount of security is sometimes not tolerable by
everyone. For certain applications the debug mode with all the iterator
checking turned on can be extremely slow, to the point of being useless.
I faced a similar problem and so had to investigate to find the reason
for the slow behaviour. I discovered that there are 2 mutually exclusive
checking mechanisms in the STL of Visual C++: checked iterators and
iterator debugging.</p>
<p><strong>Checked Iterators</strong></p>
<p><strong><a
href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa985965.aspx">Checked
iterators</a></strong> is controlled by the preprocessor definition
_SECURE_SCL. SCL is Microsoft jargon for Standard C++ Library. So, this
is a feature by Microsoft to provide some amount of minimal security on
the usage of STL iterators. The overhead of _SECURE_SCL is so low that
by default it is ON for both Release and Debug modes. So, _SECURE_SCL is
rarely the cause of your program being slow. It should be left at its
default options.</p>
<p><strong>Iterator Debugging</strong></p>
<p><a
href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa985982.aspx"><strong>Iterator
debugging</strong></a> is a whole another beast. It involves a lot more
intensive checking on the validity of iterators. It does this both when
iterators are dereferenced and when containers change internally. This
was implemented by Dinkumware, who are the creators of the STL
implementation that Visual C++ ships with.</p>
<p>By default, iterator debugging is turned ON for Debug mode and OFF
for Release mode. Typically it is not slow for Debug mode, but if the
C++ code has a lot of loops over STL containers and uses iterators
heavily, then it can make everything very slow. How slow can it get?
This is the difference I saw in one of my programs compiled in Debug
mode:</p>
<blockquote>
Iterator Debugging ON: 51.83 sec Iterator Debugging OFF: 0.27 sec
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, iterator debugging was a jaw-dropping <strong>192</strong> times
slower! Not just that, at ~52 seconds of execution, this program was
unusable for my purpose!</p>
<p>Iterator debugging is controlled by the preprocessor definition
<strong><a
href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa985939.aspx">_HAS_ITERATOR_DEBUGGING</a></strong>.
To turn off iterator debugging, add
<code>_HAS_ITERATOR_DEBUGGING=0</code> to the <em>Preprocessor
Definitions</em> in <em>C++ → Preprocessor</em> section of the project
properties.</p>

Iterator Debugging and Secure SCL</a></strong> video on Channel 9 by
Stephan T. Lavavej. A must watch video for anyone using STL on Visual
C++. Stephan explains both Secure SCL and Iterator Debugging and how
they are implemented internally in the library. Also explained is when
and which of these options to turn ON or OFF.</li>
