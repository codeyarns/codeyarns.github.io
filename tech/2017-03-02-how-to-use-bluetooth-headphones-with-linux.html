<p>One of the irritating problems with <strong>Linux</strong> in general
is <strong>Bluetooth</strong>. Below are the steps I had to follow to
pair and use a <strong>Creative WP-300</strong> Bluetooth headphones
with <strong>Kubuntu 16.04</strong>. The procedure should be similar for
any Bluetooth headphones or speaker and with any other variant of
Ubuntu.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Make sure that your computer has a Bluetooth adapter and it is
working. Do not just assume there is an adapter and its working in
Linux! You should be able to see a Bluetooth icon in the system panel or
system tray. In the Bluetooth settings you should be able to see the
adapter.</p></li>
<li><p>Power on your Bluetooth headphones or speaker and put it into
<strong>pairing mode</strong>. Refer to its documentation if you do not
know how to do this.</p></li>
<li><p>Go to the Bluetooth settings in Linux and try to
<strong>find</strong> device and once the device is listed,
<strong>pair</strong> with it and connect to it.</p></li>
<li><p>Go to the audio settings and you should be able to see the
Bluetooth device listed there. If it is not there, you might need to
restart Linux. I know it is crazy, I had to do this, since no other
solution offered online worked for me!</p></li>
<li><p>If your device is listed in audio settings then try to play some
music or video and see if it plays in the device. Most probably, it will
still play on the default speaker of your computer! Go to System
Settings → Multimedia → Audio and Video → Device Preference → Audio
Playback. Your Bluetooth device must be listed here. Grab it and move it
above the built-in audio device. This tells Linux to use this as the
default audio output.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Now you should be able to playback audio to your Bluetooth device
👍</p>
