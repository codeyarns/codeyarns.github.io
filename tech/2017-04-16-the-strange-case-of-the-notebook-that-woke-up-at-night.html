<h2 id="problem">Problem</h2>
<p>In the last week, I started noticing that my notebook, that I had suspended before going to sleep would have woken up during the night! This notebook was running <strong>Ubuntu 16.04</strong>. It took a bit of investigation to realize that the notebook was being woken up by my new <strong>Targus AMW071</strong> wireless mouse. Some slight vibration to the desk during the night would move the mouse and it would wake up Linux from its sleep!</p>
<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>
<p>The list of devices that can wake up Linux from sleep is listed in the file <code>/proc/acpi/wakeup</code>. Each line of that file has a four-letter device code, obtained from BIOS, and whether that device is enabled (can wakeup from sleep) or disabled.</p>
<p>I checked which devices could wakeup my Linux:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat /proc/acpi/wakeup | grep enabled
XHC   S3    *enabled   pci:0000:00:14.0
PWRB      S3    *enabled   platform:PNP0C0C:00
SLPB      S3    *enabled   platform:PNP0C0E:00
LID0      S3    *enabled   platform:PNP0C0D:00</code></pre>
<p>The culprit here was <code>XHC</code>, the USB 3.0 hub to which the mouse was connected. <code>PWRB</code> and <code>SLPB</code> are Power buttons and <code>LID0</code> is the notebook lid. So, I had to disable the <code>XHC</code> device in this file. Now, if the device name is written to this file, that operation toggles the enabled or disabled state for that device.</p>
<p>So, to disable my mouse from waking up my notebook, I created this shell script:</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
# disable_wakeup.sh
echo &quot;XHC&quot; &gt; /proc/acpi/wakeup</code></pre>
<p>And I executed that file with superuser privileges:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo ./disable_wakeup.sh</code></pre>
<p>I could see that this had disabled the mouse from waking up my notebook:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat /proc/acpi/wakeup | grep enabled
PWRB      S3    *enabled   platform:PNP0C0C:00
SLPB      S3    *enabled   platform:PNP0C0E:00
LID0      S3    *enabled   platform:PNP0C0D:00</code></pre>
<p>I suspended the notebook and also verified that indeed the mouse could not wake it up.</p>
<p>The only problem left now was that this toggle would apply only for this Linux session. A system reboot would put back the <code>XHC</code> device in enabled state. To run this toggle script on every system reboot:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo crontab -e
@reboot /home/joe/scripts/disable_wakeup.sh</code></pre>
<p>Now I had a permanent solution that makes sure that the mouse can never wake up my Ubuntu from sleep! 😊</p>
