<p>The <strong>C++ standard</strong> is the definitive source for the language. The committee that works on the C++ standard is called the <strong>C++ Standards Committee</strong> or <strong>Working Group 21</strong> or <strong>WG21</strong> for short. All information about this committee is shared at the <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/">WG21 website</a>.</p>
<p>WG21 regularly reviews changes to the standard and accepts them for addition to the next standard. These <em>commits</em> are available as <strong>drafts</strong> that the committee shares to the public for free. However, at a certain magical commit, the committee accepts the last few changes on top of a publicly released draft and <em>blesses</em> that as the new standard. However, the official standard is only available through the ISO for a fee.</p>
<p>Historical drafts of the standard that come from WG21 or the latest draft from WG21 are not of interest to most C++ programmers. What is useful for most folks are the official standards. But, those are not free. So, what folks typically do is to grab the <em>last draft before a standard</em> that they are interested in.</p>
<p>For example, assume I have access to only a C++11 compiler and I witness a compilation anomaly. I would be interested in consulting the last draft before the C++11 standard.</p>
<p>WG21 provides a handy redirection service at <a href="https://wg21.link/">wg21.link</a> to obtain all sorts of documents are generated by the committee.</p>

<p>The redirection links that can be used to download draft PDFs relevant to C++ standards are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://wg21.link/std11">C++11</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://wg21.link/std14">C++14</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://wg21.link/std17">C++17</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>The latest draft standard can be compiled from its LaTeX source to PDF for free:</p>
<ul>
<li>Install these LaTeX packages:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>$ sudo apt-get install latexmk texlive-latex-recommended texlive-latex-extra texlive-fonts-recommended</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Clone the C++ draft standard repository:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>$ git clone git@github.com:cplusplus/draft.git</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Build a PDF of the standard:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>$ cd source
$ latexmk -pdf std</code></pre>
<p>If there are too many warnings, you might need to run the above command a second time. The result is a PDF of the C++ standard!</p>
