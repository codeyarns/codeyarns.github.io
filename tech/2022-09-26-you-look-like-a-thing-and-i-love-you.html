<p>AI has been <em>the</em> buzz for the past few years and so it is no
surprise that there are AI books aimed at a general audience now. One
such book is <strong>You Look Like a Thing and I Love You</strong>
written by <strong>Janelle Shane</strong>. She apparently is behind the
<a href="https://www.aiweirdness.com/"><strong>AI Weirdness</strong></a>
website, which I do not follow. This book is written for the non-tech
layman, explaining the basics of what is today’s AI, how it is created
and deployed, and what it can and cannot do.</p>
<p>Folks who actually work with deep learning know how far it is from
human-level Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). But how do you
explain that to the layman? This book can be of help. It lays out <em>5
principles of AI weirdness</em>: it is not smart enough, has the brains
of a worm, doesn’t understand general problems, does exactly what it is
ordered and takes the path of least resistance.</p>
<p>The introductory chapters show how AI is all pervasive today: search
engines, text-to-speech, text correction/prediction, enhancing photos
and pretty much every task we perform with our phones or computers. A
chapter on learning uses a simple feedforward network to illustrate DL
training. It also glosses over other types of ML like Markov Chains,
random forests, evolutionary algorithms, GANs.</p>
<p>The middle chapters are the meat of the book, where the author
repeatedly goes over examples of how AI can only solve a narrow problem
it is trained for with its training data. So, we are introduced to all
the myriad ways in which bad data, unbalanced data, missing data, and
reward functions affect the AI created by it. We see how AI always take
the shortcut during training, usually in ways unintended by the creating
human.</p>
<p>One of the chapters compares AI to the human brain and shows in
several ways how it is forgetful, easy to trip, easy to hack and
subvert. These issues are already big problems for AIs and are bound to
get messier as AIs take over more functions that affect humans
(insurance, loan, law, policing).</p>
<p>The final chapters look at how many companies cheat by using humans
behind what they call as AI. It also looks at how many products use a
hybrid AI+human approaches, where AI handles the boring/easy tasks and
calls in a human when it finds the situation difficult. (Think of the
chatbots now used by banks and other online services.)</p>
<p>All in all, this is an easy and funny book to read, both for techies
and non-techies. Not much value for ML/DL folks, decent value for
general techies and great value for a general audience. As a person who
is fairly involved in the DL field, I got this general feel that the
book was a “could-have-been-a-blog” cobbled together from popular DL
Twitter news and memes of the past few years. Another shortcoming was
the overuse of text models (recipe creation for example) in several
chapters for illustration. The author seems to be a cartoonist, her fun
visual illustrations are peppered on every page and they form a huge
part of the narrative - a huge plus that makes all the concepts easy to
understand through visual aids. This book goes a long way in bringing
some sanity to the AI hype that the press is constantly trying to whip
up to grab eyeballs.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 3/4</p>
