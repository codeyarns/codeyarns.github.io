<p><strong>Raspbian</strong> is a great distribution for the <strong>Raspberry Pi</strong>. However, by default it installs a lot of big packages meant for schools and education. This is not great for many users who tend to install it on a <strong>SD card</strong> which has limited space and use it as a headless computer. I was surprised to see little space left on a 4GB SD card after installing Raspbian.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I was able to find the biggest packages by install size using Aptitude, as described <a href="2015/06/18/how-to-list-packages-by-size-using-aptitude/">here</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>The biggest installed packages turned out to be:</p></li>
</ul>
<pre><code>wolfram-engine   460 MB
oracle-java8-jdk 186 MB
pypy-upstream     57 MB 
scratch           46 MB 
freepats          34 MB </code></pre>
<p>I was quite surprised to see the gigantic Wolfram and Oracle's version of Java 8 (and not OpenJDK) being installed by default in Raspbian!</p>
<p>After removing the big packages that you don't need, you can gain back a lot of space :)</p>
<p><strong>Tried with:</strong> Raspbian 7</p>
