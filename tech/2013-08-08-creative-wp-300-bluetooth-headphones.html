<p>In the quest to make my computer usage as wireless as possible, I
recently switched from my <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0050MM40C/"><strong>Dunu
DN-12</strong></a> earphones to <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004D4R9VC/"><strong>Creative
WP-300</strong></a> Bluetooth headphones. Right out of the box, these
headphones look great. The industrial design is good, boxing way above
its price point. The chrome rings, the tiny lights, the soft-click
buttons, the leather cups and the hefty metal bar, all beautiful. You
can see that a lot of thought went into this design.</p>
<h2 id="bluetooth">Bluetooth</h2>
<p>The headphones worked fine with almost all the devices at home. It
paired and connected easily with both Ubuntu and Windows notebooks. It
worked with a Samsung Galaxy smartphone and a Nook Color tablet, both
running Android. Only my ancient Nokia C1-01 paired with it, but could
not connect to the headphones.</p>
<h2 id="sound">Sound</h2>
<p>The sound quality is good, but not great. Let me explain. The sound
seems truer and balanced, all the little details can be heard, thought
the bass is a wee bit noticeable. It is almost similar to how my Dunu
DN-12 earphones sound. But, the sound is not as enjoyable as my <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002VPDOH8/"><strong>Sennheiser
PX100-II</strong></a> headphones, which remains my favorite.</p>
<h2 id="buttons">Buttons</h2>
<p>The soft click buttons for power, play-pause, forward and backward
are placed on the right can. They are easy to operate while wearing the
headphones without much fumbling. The volume keys are placed to the
bottom back of the right can. Again, very easy to find and change
volume. In just a few hours of usage, using this headphone becomes
second nature to your right hand.</p>
<h2 id="lights">Lights</h2>
<p>The light indicators are tiny and perfect. It takes a bit of guessing
in the beginning, but become like second knowledge in just a few tries.
The colors of the lights and how they blink is enough to deduce what is
happening with the headphones. Add to that the beeping sounds heard when
wearing it that indicate that its on, is connected or is low on power.
All just right!</p>
<h2 id="size">Size</h2>
<p>The cans are a bit small, they are designed to sit on the ear, not
enclose them. This is all right, but I felt that the cans pressed a bit
hard on my ears. I notice this only after wearing them for an hour or
more. I think this should go away with usage, once the metal expands
to accommodate my head radius. The can rotates to be stored flat and a
travel bag is provided which can be used for taking it along wherever
you go.</p>
<h2 id="battery">Battery</h2>
<p>Charging the headphones is easy, using a micro-USB cable. It ships
with one, but you can use any cable lying around. And you can use the
headphones while its charging. When the in-built battery is running low,
the headphones will gently beep every minute indicating this status. The
charging is surprisingly fast, about an hour to full charge! And a full
charge lasted me 3 days, with a couple of hours of usage every day.</p>
<h2 id="going-wireless">Going wireless</h2>
<p>The best part about this set is that I’m discovering how great
wireless headphones are in many tiny little ways. I can do my chores,
wash dishes or cook, without having to deal with wires interfering with
my hands. While working at the desk I no longer have to think about the
leash length of the headphones, when I need to bend over or move a bit
to grab something. My headphones were always getting knocked out because
I would elbow the wires. That is a problem in the past now. If I need to
grab a drink or snack or even visit the bathroom at home, I can do all
that while wearing the headphones! The Bluetooth range seems sufficient
enough to get through 2 rooms or walls.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I have been happy with the Creative WP-300 Bluetooth headphones. It
can work with all the notebooks, tablets and smartphones at home. I
don’t think I’ll be buying any wired headphones in the future. The
convenience of going wireless is that great. I only wish the sound was a
bit more enjoyable, but folks who want a truer sound might like the
balanced sound of the WP-300. The price is really great for how gorgeous
these set of headphones look, how well its UI is designed and it
works.</p>
