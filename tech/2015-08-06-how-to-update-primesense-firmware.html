<p>My <strong>Primesense RD1.09</strong> cameras were having lots of trouble working under <strong>Linux</strong>. They had no problems working under Windows.</p>
<p>One of the suggestions I found online was to update their firmware. Note that the firmware update can only be done from a <strong>Windows</strong> computer. I followed these steps to update:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Remove all OpenNI 1.x or 2.x SDK installed on Windows.</p></li>
<li><p>Remove the driver for Primesense camera as described <a href="http://codeyarns.com/2015/08/06/how-to-remove-driver-in-windows/">here</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Install the latest OpenNI 2.x SDK by downloading it from <a href="http://structure.io/openni">here</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Plug in the Primesense camera and ensure that it is detected in <strong>Device Manager</strong>. Strangely my camera is detected as a Primesense 1.08x device! I have no idea why this happens.</p></li>
<li><p>Get the firmware update software from <a href="http://dasl.mem.drexel.edu/wiki/index.php/4._Updating_Firmware_for_Primesense">here</a>. There are two versions of firmware, which one to pick? See below.</p></li>
<li><p>Unzip the firmware and run the EXE file. It should change some settings and show a SUCCESS in the console. If you get a FAILURE, then make sure you followed the OpenNI removal and driver removal steps above.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Which firmware version to pick?</strong> There are two versions: one for <code>RD108</code> and another for <code>RD109</code> devices. My camera says <code>RD1.09</code> on the back, but shows up in Windows as a <code>1.08x</code> device! Which version of firmware should I use? I tried both and here is my experience. When I used <code>RD109</code> firmware, the camera would give this error on Linux:</p>
<pre><code>One or more of the following nodes could not be enumerated:
Device: PrimeSense/SensorV2/5.1.0.41: The device is not connected!</code></pre>
<p>I went back and tried the <code>RD108</code> firmware and the camera worked under Linux after that :-)</p>
<p><strong>Tried with:</strong> OpenNI 2.2.0.33 and Windows 7 x64</p>
