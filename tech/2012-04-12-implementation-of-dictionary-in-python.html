<p>During a <strong><a href="http://www.udacity.com/">Udacity</a>
CS101</strong> class, Prof. <strong>David Evans</strong> introduces
Python dictionaries and mentions that the viewer can learn more about
the implementation of this data type in the book <strong>Beautiful
Code</strong>. I looked it up and Chapter 18 of the book titled
<strong>Python’s Dictionary Implementation: Being All Things to All
People</strong> written by <strong>Andrew Kuchling</strong> actually
turned out to be quite interesting.</p>
<p>Here are some notes about the dictionary implementation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dictionary is used heavily in Python:
<ul>
<li>In Python programs, dictionaries are the most popular data type
after lists.</li>
<li>Python’s implementation of classes uses dictionary underneath to
store the class <strong>attributes</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Keyword arguments</strong> to functions are implemented
using dictionary. So, a dictionary is created and destroyed on each such
function call.</li>
<li>Due to such popular and diverse uses, the dictionary needs to offer
fast lookup and insertion, fast creation and destruction and should be
conservative on memory use.</li>
<li>In CPython, dictionary is implemented as a <strong>hash
table</strong>. The number of <strong>slots</strong> in the table is a
power-of-2.</li>
<li>Each slot has three items: pointer to the <strong>key</strong>,
pointer to the <strong>value</strong> and a copy of the
<strong>hash</strong> of the key. The hash is cached for fast
comparison, instead of having to touch the key (which may be large) and
compute hash from that.</li>
<li>Unlike a typical hash table, the hash of the key is not an index
into the table. Instead, the (hash &amp; mask) is the index into the
table. Mask is the table-size - 1.</li>
<li><strong>Open addressing</strong> is used to deal with
<strong>collision</strong>. Linear probing, the simplest open addressing
technique, is useless because of how a hash is converted to index (see
above). Instead, the bits of the hash are used to perturb until an empty
slot is found.</li>
<li>The table is <strong>resized</strong> when it becomes 2/3 full. The
<strong>resize factor</strong> is chosen based on the number of keys. If
less than 50,000 keys, the factor is 4, else 2.</li>
<li>A lot of the dictionaries used internally by Python have string
keys. To optimize for these, a dictionary always begins its life with a
string-only <strong>lookup function</strong>. Only on the first
non-string lookup or insertion, the lookup function switched permanently
to a slower generic lookup function.</li>
<li>Most dictionaries tend to be small. To optimize for this, a 8-slot
hash table is an integral part of the dictionary object. This small
table can fit inside two 64-byte cache lines. A larger table is
allocated and it is used instead of the small table when the number of
keys increases beyond 5.</li>
<li>Internally, Python maintains an array of dictionaries that were used
and discarded earlier. These are reused whenever possible, instead of
creating new dictionaries from scratch.</li>
<li>I looked up some of the above data structures and functions in <a
href="http://hg.python.org/cpython/">CPython source code</a>. Much like
Python itself, its implementation is refreshingly simple, easy to read
and understand. The relevant files are:
<code>Include/dictobject.h</code>, <code>Objects/dictobject.c</code> and
<code>Objects/dictnotes.txt</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>I hope you have fun spelunking the dictionary implementation in
Python. 😊</p>
