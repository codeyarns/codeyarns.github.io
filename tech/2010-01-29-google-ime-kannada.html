<p>Google has <a
href="http://googleindia.blogspot.com/2010/01/google-transliteration-ime-available-in_28.html">released</a>
its IME for Indian languages! And ಹೌದು (yes), <em><a
href="http://www.google.com/ime/transliteration/">Google Kannada
IME</a></em> is available! 😊</p>
<p>I am using it as my primary Kannada IME and it is pretty impressive.
I was using the <em><a
href="http://www.baraha.com/help/BarahaUnicode/BarahaIME.htm">Baraha
IME</a></em> for Kannada transliteration until now. It is too early to
comment on how Google Kannada IME handles the esoteric characters or
words of the language or on its performance. But, it is definitely a
good user experience, right out of the door. <em><a
href="http://www.google.com/ime/pinyin/">Google Pinyin IME</a></em> has
been available for years now and is a big hit. Surely their experience
in that has served them well for other (easier) languages. (A Chinese
language IME is any day far harder than any of the Indian
languages.)</p>
<p>One major plus with the Google IME is that it shows word suggestions
as you type. It also looks like Google IME maintains a user cache where
I assume it will store the user picks of words. That should help the IME
suggestions get better with time. Also to be noted is that this is yet
another area where Google has <em>squarely</em> beaten Microsoft. All
the NT flavours of Windows have always had complete Unicode support from
the kernel up, but their <a href="http://bhashaindia.com/">Kannada
IME</a> was never a good experience. They stagnated development on their
IMEs and look who got their goat! All in all, Google IME is a refreshing
new experience to type in ಕನ್ನಡ (Kannada)! 😊</p>
