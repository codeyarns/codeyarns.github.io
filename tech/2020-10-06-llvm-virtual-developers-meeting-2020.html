<p>I had been meaning to attend the <a
href="https://llvm.org/devmtg/"><strong>LLVM Developers’
Meeting</strong></a> for a couple of years now, mostly because it
happens right next door in San Jose. <a
href="https://llvm.org/devmtg/2020-09/">This year</a> the conference
went virtual and actually made it easy for me to finally attend all 3
days <strong>(Oct 6-8)</strong>. Below are my notes from the talks I
attended from their multiple-track agenda. This being the first time I
am attending a compiler conference, let alone a LLVM one, I focused on
gaining basic knowledge of the software architecture of compilers, usage
of common tools and techniques in the field.</p>
<h2 id="overall-review-of-the-conference">Overall review of the
conference</h2>
<p>This was my first virtual conference and I was highly skeptical if it
would work out. But I was pleasantly surprised how well the conference
was!</p>
<ul>
<li>There is a <strong>good mix</strong> of talks about introductory
topics, useful tools, and usage tutorials. I had never been to a
compiler conference and I learnt so much practical information about
LLVM and GCC compilers and associated tools. I will be sure to attend
this conference every year.</li>
<li>The organizers used a service called <a
href="https://whova.com/"><strong>Whova</strong></a> to organize and
host the entire conference. Whova made it easy to look at the agenda,
choose talks, attend talks, switch between talks and it has a good
Android app too.</li>
<li>The <strong>talks</strong> are pre-recorded, so they all finished on
time, with a good pace and had 5-10 minutes of Q&amp;A. You have no idea
how fantastic the pre-recorded on-time talks mean to me. This is because
my biggest gripe in conferences is that many speakers spend their entire
time on 2 starting slides, and then ram through 30 slides in the last 5
minutes and then go and eat up the Q&amp;A time too. That sucks. For
this conference, I saw that for a few speakers, who might have taken
longer time, the organizers had edited their talks down to the
designated time.</li>
<li>The Whova interface allowed attendees to ask questions and vote on
them. After each pre-recorded talk was played out, there was a live
<strong>Q&amp;A</strong> session with the speaker and a chair. The chair
would ask the speaker the questions we had typed in during the talk.
There was a <strong>chat</strong> section in each talk for the attendees
to chat amongst us too.</li>
<li>After the talk is over, it is uploaded to and available on
<strong>Youtube</strong>. Sadly, only the pre-recorded part of the talk
is uploaded, not the live Q&amp;A at the end.</li>
<li>There were <strong>coffee breaks</strong> in a virtual room where
you could gather around virtual tables and talk with the other attendee
avatars. I did not try this since the schedule was too packed that I
need the break time for myself.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="day-1">Day 1</h2>
<h3 id="everything-i-know-about-debugging-llvm"><a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vmJuLfIpY4">Everything I know
about debugging LLVM</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Talk by Nick Desaulniers, who works on compiling the Linux kernel
with LLVM at Google. (<a
href="https://clangbuiltlinux.github.io/llvm-dev-conf-2020/nick/debugging_llvm.html#/">Slides</a>)</li>
<li>Begins with a brief introduction to stages of C++ code compilation
with clang and the LLVM source code paths of those modules.</li>
<li>The clang driver converts C++ code to LLVM IR. Stages in it are
preprocessor, lexer, parser (generates AST), SEMA (Semantic Analysis and
Template Instantiation) and LLVM IR emission (CodeGen).</li>
<li>Abstractions of input code in LLVM are llvm::module (translation
unit), llvm::function, llvm::basicBlock and llvm::Instruction.</li>
<li>IR has 3 representations: in-memory during runtime, textual for
read/write by humans and binary serialized for files.</li>
<li>CodeGen: General code generation happens in llvm/lib/CodeGen and
machine specific code generation happens in llvm/lib/target/XYZ</li>
<li>There are four types of register allocators.</li>
<li>ASM streamer writes the different types of object files.</li>
<li>Building LLVM: cmake to generate build files, ninja to invoke
build.</li>
<li>LLD is faster than BFD. BFD is the default linker on Linux.</li>
<li>llvm-readelf tool can be used to check if a library file was built
using LLVM.</li>
<li>opt tool can be used to run different optimizations on IR
files.</li>
<li>creduce and cvise can be used to do test case reduction.</li>
<li>LLVM weekly and blog are good resources.</li>
<li>“The master has failed more times than the disciple has even
tried.”</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="llvm-in-a-bare-metal-environment"><a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5GA8ZGZyrk">LLVM in a Bare Metal
Environment</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Talk by Hafiz Abid Qadeer.</li>
<li>A typical compiled binary or library runs atop of the OS and with
the support of dynamically linked libraries. This talk was about how to
compile a binary that can run baremetal on hardware with no OS in
between using the LLVM toolchain.</li>
<li>I dropped out halfway from this talk because this was a topic which
was not relevant to me.</li>
</ul>
<h3
id="branch-coverage-squeezing-more-out-of-llvm-source-based-code-coverage"><a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbcZeodxvgc">Branch Coverage:
Squeezing more out of LLVM Source-based Code Coverage</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Talk by Alan Phipps.</li>
<li>LLVM’s coverage tool has support for function, line and region
coverage. But it does not have branch coverage, which the speaker
added.</li>
<li>Counters are used at function, statement and condition and
incremented when they are executed.</li>
<li>Using simple if conditions, the speaker explained how he added
counters to add branch coverage.</li>
<li>MC/DC is a future work once branch coverage is checked into
LLVM.</li>
<li>GCC gcov (console output) and lcov (HTML output) are the competitors
which already have branch coverage, with some caveats.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="checked-c-adding-memory-safety-support-to-llvm"><a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIlBWIiV68U">Checked C: Adding
memory safety support to LLVM</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Talk by Mandeep Singh Grang and Katherine Kjeer.</li>
<li>Checked C adds 3 new pointer types to C to handle buffer overflow
and null pointer dereference.</li>
<li>New pointer types are <code>_Ptr&lt;T&gt;</code>,
<code>_Array_ptr&lt;T&gt;</code> and
<code>_Nt_array_ptr&lt;T&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>There exists a Checked C tool that can convert C code to Checked C
code.</li>
</ul>

<h3
id="using-clang-tidy-for-customized-checkers-and-large-scale-source-tree-refactoring"><a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCJxnApRJM4">Using clang-tidy for
customized checkers and large scale source tree refactoring</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Talk by Vince Bridgers.</li>
<li>Most bugs are introduced early in the development process, but
discovered and fixed late. Thus the cost of having a bug in the code is
pretty high. Weeding out bugs as early as possible reduces software
cost.</li>
<li>Types of program analysis tools:
<ul>
<li>Compiler diagnostics: Warnings from GCC and Clang. Part of
compilation.</li>
<li>Linters and style checkers: Use text/AST matching. An extra step
after compilation.</li>
<li>Static analysis: cppcheck, GCC 10+, clang. These use symbolic
execution. An extra step after compilation.</li>
<li>Dynamic analysis: valgrind, gcc, clang. Injection of runtime checks
or library. Long runtimes due to running extra code. An extra step after
compilation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>LLVM compiler flow is: Frontend -&gt; Optimizer -&gt; CodeGen</li>
<li>clang-tidy: Uses AST matchers to find and replace patterns. It has
full access to AST and preprocessor. There are 200+ existing checks. It
is extensible to add custom checks.</li>
<li><code>clang-tidy --list-checks</code>: To list all currently active
checks. This is <em>not</em> the full list of available checks.</li>
<li><code>clang-tidy --list-checks -checks=*</code>: Lists all available
checks.</li>
<li><code>clang-tidy ... -checks=-*,&lt;your specific check&gt;</code>:
To pick out a specific check to apply.</li>
<li><code>clang-tidy ... --fix</code>: Not just check, but also fix the
errors found.</li>
<li><a
href="https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/checks/list.html">Full
list</a> of available checks. Checks with fixes are indicated in the
second column.</li>
<li><code>clang-query</code> is an interactive tool to play around with
clang C++ API to query AST and figure out the calls to match a
pattern.</li>
<li>Write the new custom check (and fix) in C++ code and add to
clang-tidy using
<code>add_new_check.py &lt;category&gt; &lt;check name&gt;</code></li>
<li>There are clang-tidy tools to apply checks across an entire codebase
in parallel without the fixes overwriting on each other.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="llvm-libc-current-status-challenges-and-future-plans"><a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ae8WdR_1z_4">LLVM Libc: Current
Status, Challenges and Future Plans</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Talk by Siva Chandra Reddy.</li>
<li>Motivations to create a new cleanroom implementation of libc:
sanitizer friendly, use standard C/C++ and no assembly and to make it
modular so that users can mix libc pieces from different libc
implementations (like GNU libc and MUSL).</li>
<li>LLVM libc uses C++ templates internally to reduce code for different
variants of math functions.</li>
<li>threads.h (mutex and thread functions) and signal.h will be platform
specific code.</li>
<li>mmap, munmap: Used for creation and destruction of thread stacks for
threads.</li>
<li>Loader: It starts the user application calling main at the end and
also cleans up after the application has ended.</li>
<li>Static-PIE ELF loader is in the works.</li>
<li>It will be a few years before this has all the libc functions and
can fully replace GNU libc on just Linux. Other platforms are more years
away.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="code-size-compiler-optimizations-and-techniques"><a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_m4AY-MXD8">Code Size Compiler
Optimizations and Techniques</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>By Aditya Kumar.</li>
<li>Explicit template instantiations reduce code size and compilation
time.</li>
<li>Move function definitions from headers to source files. Especially
with C++, which adds ctors, dtors, operator overloading and explicit
template instantiations.</li>
<li>Use <code>__attribute__((noinline))</code> and
<code>__attribute__((cold))</code>.</li>
<li>list and array are cheaper than vector and deque. map and set are
cheaper than unordered_map and unordered_set.</li>
<li>Avoid sorting if possible. Bubble sort is cheaper than quick sort.
And linear search is cheaper than binary search.</li>
<li>Move rarely used functions to shared library to reduce program
launch time.</li>
<li>elfcompress can compress sections.</li>
<li>llvm-strip can strip symbols.</li>
</ul>

id="accelerate-matrix-multiplication-using-the-new-power-outer-product-instructions"><a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qG9NbJnEXaQ">Accelerate Matrix
Multiplication Using the New POWER Outer Product Instructions</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Talk by Baptiste Saleil and João Carvalho.</li>
<li>MMA instructions have been added to PowerISA 3.1. So they will be
available in POWER10 and later CPUs.</li>
<li>The motivation is to speedup kernels of matrix multiplication and
convolutions used in deep learning.</li>
<li>8 new accumulators which are 512-bit registers. Each accumulator is
associated with 4 existing 128-bit VSR registers.</li>
<li>3 types of instructions have been added:
<ul>
<li>Move data to and from MMA accumulators: To move data to accumulator
or set to zero use primed instructions (VSR-&gt;acc). To move data from
accumulator use unprimed instruction (acc-&gt;VSR).</li>
<li>Integer MMA instructions: Multiply two 4x2 inputs to produce 4x4
output. Inputs are typically lower precision (Ex: INT16) than outputs
(Ex: INT32). Available for all INT types like INT16, INT32, INT8,
INT4.</li>
<li>Floating point MMA instructions: Multiply two 4x2 inputs to produce
4x4 output. Same as INT above. Available for all supported float types:
FP64, FP32, FP16 and Bfloat16.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>New API has been added based on LLVM compiler intrinsics.</li>
<li>New optimization pass has been added to LLVM to identify GEMM
variants in IR to map to MMA instructions.</li>
<li>LLVM recently added <code>llvm.matrix.*</code> instructions that can
be used for this mapping. <code>llvm.matrix.column.major.load()</code>
to load matrix for MMA and <code>llvm.matrix.multiply()</code> to do
MMA.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="matrix-support-in-clang-and-llvm"><a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPFZFSROxLk">Matrix Support in
Clang and LLVM</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Talk by Florian Hahn.</li>
<li>Support for multiplication of <em>small</em> matrices is now added.
This is for matrices of sizes ranging from 2x2 to 16x16. These matrices
are small enough to fit in the vector registers of common CPUs.</li>
<li>The matrices are column major by default.</li>
<li>Supporting matrix types in LLVM/Clang guarantees vector code
generation for this code and also removes unnecessary memory
access.</li>
<li>For C/C++ code Clang supports:
<ul>
<li>New matrix type with number of columns and rows specified at compile
time.</li>
<li>Operation <code>*</code> defined for multiplication of matrices and
<code>+</code> and <code>-</code> defined for elementwise addition and
subtraction of matrices.</li>
<li><code>[][]</code> defined as element subscript operator for
matrices.</li>
<li>New builtins for transpose, store to memory (with user strides) and
load from memory (with user strides).</li>
<li>More details at <a
href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/MatrixTypes.html">Matrix
types</a>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In LLVM IR:
<ul>
<li>New instructions of the form <code>@llvm.matrix.*</code>.</li>
<li>The matrix is embedded in flat vectors.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="lightning-talks"><a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSMputNvHlk">Lightning
Talks</a></h3>
<p>I noted the following from the talks which were 5-minutes each:</p>
<ul>
<li>NVIDIA has contributed <strong>Flang</strong>, Fortran compiler
frontend to LLVM.</li>
<li>There was a person who had written a CUDA backend for SyCL</li>
<li>LLDB debugger supports scripting using Python
(<code>import lldb</code>) and other languages like Lua using SWIG.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="day-3">Day 3</h2>
<h3 id="mlir-tutorial"><a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhXT4RXjzLI">MLIR
Tutorial</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>By Mehdi Amini and River Riddle.</li>
<li>MLIR is a framework to build a compiler IR. We can define type
systems, operations in it.</li>
<li>Uses could be for various code generation strategies and to support
accelerators.</li>
<li>MLIR is being used to process graphs in TensorFlow/XLA/ONNX and for
Flang IR.</li>
<li>The rest of the tutorial shows how to use MLIR for a Toy language.
The content of this tutorial is <a
href="https://mlir.llvm.org/docs/Tutorials/Toy/">online</a>.</li>
<li>Operations are the most basic component of MLIR. Everything is an
operation in MLIR. MLIR operation is different from LLVM
instruction.</li>
<li>All operations share the same structure. Operations can have
regions, blocks and other operations.</li>
<li>Dialect defines the rules and semantics of an IR. It has namespace,
operations, types and passes.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cil--common-mlir-dialect-for-cc-and-fortran"><a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNA5bwsKepQ">CIL : Common MLIR
Dialect for C/C++ and Fortran</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>By Prashantha NR, Vinay Madhusudan and Ranjith Kumar.</li>
<li>Motivation for CIL:
<ul>
<li>C/C++ does not have a middle level IR. LLVM IR is too low level for
some optimizations. C/C++ STL constructs need a high level IR for high
level optimizations.</li>
<li>Fortran defined its own IR, it could have reused C++ IR
instead.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Uses:
<ul>
<li>LLVM does not remove empty foreach loops in C++.</li>
<li>To handle multi-dimensional arrays.</li>
<li>To handle heterogenous computing.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>CIL is implemented as a MLIR dialect to handle C/C++ and Fortran.
After CIL-level of optimizations, it can then be lowered to LLVM IR for
low level optimizations.</li>
<li>CIL-LTO: Combines multiple MLIR modules into a single MLIR module.
Useful to do LTO like function inlining, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="llvm-based-mutation-testing-for-c-and-c"><a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGM1AocRUQw">LLVM-based mutation
testing for C and C++</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>By Alex Denisov</li>
<li>Mutation testing shows the semantic gaps between test suite and the
software. It finds out incorrect tests, potential vulnerabilities and
dead code.</li>
<li>The idea is to mutate code, compile, link, run tests and repeat. So
mutation testing is very costly.</li>
<li>Example of mutation: Replace <code>*</code> with <code>+</code> and
check if unit tests fail or not.</li>
<li>Mull is a mutation testing tool for C/C++. Mull makes it performant
to do mutation testing. It relies on bitcode generated by LLVM and works
by forking processes and switching function pointers to different
mutants and testing them. This avoids a whole compilation loop for each
mutant.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="adding-cuda-support-to-cling-jit-compile-to-gpus"><a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D93sTPMAoQw">Adding CUDA Support
to Cling: JIT Compile to GPUs</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>By Simeon Ehrig.</li>
<li>Cling is a JIT compiler for C++ code. Can be used at the terminal
like a REPL interpreter or in Jupyter notebook.</li>
<li>For each new statement, Cling creates a new transaction object.
Execution statement-by-statement creates a DAG of transaction nodes.
This is how Cling allows undoing a previous statement and replacing with
a modified statement instead.</li>
<li>Speaker added CUDA kernel compilation and calling support to Cling.
Used Google’s GPUCC compiler for some of the work.</li>
</ul>
<h3
id="extending-clang-for-checking-compliance-with-automotive-coding-standards"><a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXEzGh66lOU">Extending Clang for
checking compliance with automotive coding standards</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>By Milena Vujosevic Janicic.</li>
<li>AUTOSAR has 402 rules. 150 directly from MISRA C++. 200 from other
C++ standards. 60 based on papers etc.</li>
<li>Speaker focused on required/advisory rules that are implementation
based and can be automated.</li>
<li>Some of the rules can be enforced using Clang warnings.</li>
<li>For rules that need semantic analysis, AST matchers and AST visitors
of Clang can be used.
<ul>
<li>AST matchers provide a simple way to describe patterns in AST. Can
be specified in clang-tidy checks.</li>
<li>AST visitors provide the full power of Clang AST.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>For some rules, static analyzer was used. It is a source code
analysis tool that uses both AST and CFG. But it is slower than using
AST matchers or visitors.</li>
<li>190 AUTOSAR rules have been implemented in the above way into a tool
called autocheck.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="using-the-clang-static-analyzer-to-find-bugs"><a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4iUfJx8Mn0">Using the Clang
static analyzer to find bugs</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>By Vince Bridgers.</li>
<li>Static analysis: Execute code symbolically through simulation.
Errors it finds are memory leaks, buffer overruns and logic errors.</li>
<li>Dynamic analysis: Instrument code and run the code on real target.
Examples: UBSAN, TSAN, ASAN.</li>
<li>Program analysis can exhaustively explore all execution paths in
program’s state space.</li>
<li><code>clang --analyze foobar.cpp</code>. Can also dump to a HTML
report with other options.</li>
<li>Incorporated into Ericsson’s <a
