<p>After my email account was moved to <strong>Exchange Online</strong>, I noticed that my <strong>Inbox</strong> in <strong>MS Outlook</strong> client looked different. The <strong>All</strong> and <strong>Unread</strong> tabs were replaced with two new tabs: <strong>Focused</strong> and <strong>Other</strong>. This was a new feature called <strong>Focused Inbox</strong> that intelligently was dividing up my Inbox email into these two categories.</p>
<p>After trying it for a few days, I decided I did not need it. To turn it off, go to View → Show Focused Inbox and turn it off.</p>
