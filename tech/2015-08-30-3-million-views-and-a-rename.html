<p>I am happy to note another milestone for this blog: it crossed <strong>3 million views</strong> yesterday! The blog <a href="/2015/01/06/2-million/">crossed 2 million views</a> just earlier this year in January. This is essentially just my notebook and it feels good to know that folks find some of these posts useful. This blog has now been continuously updated since <strong>2004</strong> and has <strong>1741 posts</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://codeyarns.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/20150830_stats_2.png"><img src="https://codeyarns.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/20150830_stats_2.png" alt="20150830_stats_2" /></a></p>
<p>The above graph shows the yearly traffic growth to the blog as provided by Wordpress. Most of the traffic is long tail, to lots of obscure posts written ages ago.</p>
<p><a href="https://codeyarns.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/20150830_stats_3.png"><img src="https://codeyarns.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/20150830_stats_3.png" alt="20150830_stats_3" /></a></p>
<p>This graph shows where this blog's visitors are from for this year. The top 3 sources are not surprisingly the nations with the most programmers: USA, India and Germany.</p>

<p>And finally another announcement: the name of this blog has been changed from <strong>Chooru Code</strong> to <strong>Code Yarns</strong>, with the domain changed to <a href="http://codeyarns.com"><strong>codeyarns.com</strong></a>. Quite a few folks would email me confused about the name or mispronouncing it. So, I thought that a name with English words would be better. There is nothing much to read into the name, it is just what it is: a simple domain name that was available! :-)</p>
