<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
<p>I had increased the display resolution of <strong>Ubuntu</strong> in <strong>VirtualBox</strong> using <strong>Guest Additions</strong>, as explained <a href="http://codeyarns.wordpress.com/2012/11/12/increase-resolution-of-ubuntu-in-virtualbox/">here</a>. Today it switched back magically to a small 800x600 resolution after a reboot! And also the resolution would not increase or change to match its window size.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>Ubuntu had updated itself before this happened. Apparently, it overwrites the display resolution settings or drivers that were enabled by Guest Additions. Once I suspected this, I installed Guest Additions again, as explained <a href="http://codeyarns.wordpress.com/2012/10/30/install-guest-additions-to-ubuntu-on-virtualbox/">here</a>. A reboot later, Ubuntu was in high resolution matching whatever size I dragged its window to.</p>
<p><strong>Tried with:</strong> Ubuntu 12.04, VirtualBox 4.2.4 and Windows 7 Professional x64</p>
