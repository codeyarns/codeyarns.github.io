<p>Lo behold, just a few weeks after <a href="http://codeyarns.wordpress.com/2011/12/13/notification-of-visual-studio-build-with-growl/">discovering</a> <strong>Growl for Windows</strong>, I have found something much more cooler: <a href="http://www.fullphat.net/"><strong>Snarl</strong></a>. Like Growl, Snarl is meant to gather and display notifications. But, I found it to be much better than Growl in its presentation and features. What is more, it can listen for Growl notifications and display them too. For example, I can continue to use the Growl addon I used in Visual Studio and have its build result notification show up using Snarl.</p>

<p>An added bonus is the neat set of applications that come built-in with Snarl. The <strong>Clock+</strong> application displays a notification once an hour, reminding me that another hour has passed and acts like the chime of the grandfather clock from my childhood. The <strong>AudioMon</strong> application shows the current volume as a meter when I change or mute the volume using the buttons on my laptop or my Autohotkey <a href="http://codeyarns.wordpress.com/2010/12/10/windows-7-life-without-the-volume-control/">volume shortcuts</a>. The <strong>SysInfo</strong> application monitors system parameters like battery level and notifies when it crosses a threshold.</p>
<p>Snarl is packed with features and it takes a while to iterate through its settings. But I am pretty sure you will appreciate the attention to detail the developers have put into this app. The display of the notifications is tastefully done and it is a joy to see them pop up on the screen. (I think they resemble the look of GNOME.) In addition, Snarl ships with a lot of different notification themes and styles to suit your taste.</p>
<p><strong>Tried with:</strong> Snarl R2.5 on Windows 7</p>
