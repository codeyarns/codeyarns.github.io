<p><strong>Chris Hobbs</strong> is a safety engineer who works on the
QNX real-time operating system. I discovered him while reading QNX
documentation and that led to reading his book <strong>Embedded Software
Development for Safety-Critical Systems</strong>. This book is a
practical introduction for software engineers who need to develop
software that is compliant to functional safety standards such as IEC
61508 and ISO 26262.</p>
<p>I picked up the book precisely because these IEC/ISO standards are
incredibly hard to digest. This book turned out to be truly a breath of
fresh air. It cut through so much of the jargon used in the above
standards giving simple and elegant meanings and illustrations for all
of them. For example, normal English words like fault, error and failure
have distinct and precise meanings in the safety world. And when reading
and writing in this space one needs to be clearly aware of these
meanings.</p>
<p>The author has loads of experience in the safety systems field and
that helps when he gives his personal opinion of many of the
recommendations and procedures set forth by these standards. There is a
large section of the book given to fault analysis and formal
verification which I am not sure how most software would undergo.</p>
<p>Minor quibbles aside, I found this book to be truly enlightening and
only wished it was longer and covered more of the software development
process for general and more complex software that cannot undergo formal
verification. If you are looking to comply to standards such as IEC/ISO
this book seems like a perfect no-nonsense introductory text.</p>
