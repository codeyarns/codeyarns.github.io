<h1 id="problem">Problem</h1>
<p>I wanted to share a directory that was on my local computer to a remote computer named <code>medusa</code> using <strong>NFS</strong>. I did the setup of the <strong>NFS server</strong> on my local computer and <strong>NFS client</strong> on the remote computer as described <a href="https://codeyarns.com/2013/03/17/how-to-setup-nfs-server-and-client/">here</a>. However, when I mounted the NFS share on the remote computer, I got this error:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo mount /mnt/my_nfs_share
mount.nfs: access denied by server while mounting my-local-computer:/path/i/shared</code></pre>
<h1 id="solution">Solution</h1>
<p>This turned out to be tricky one! The error message is quite a bit misleading because it turned out that the problem had nothing to do with access. Turns out this remote computer <code>medusa</code> had two Ethernet cards and thus two IP addresses. One of the IP addresses was set to the hostname <code>medusa</code>, but the NFS client was using the second IP address.</p>
<p>The solution was to add the second IP address <code>192.168.0.100</code> as an entry in the <code>/etc/exports</code> file:</p>
<pre><code>/path/i/shared medusa(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)
/path/i/shared 192.168.0.100(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)</code></pre>
<p>The rest of the steps I repeated as described in this <a href="https://codeyarns.com/2013/03/17/how-to-setup-nfs-server-and-client/">post</a>. Everything worked fine and I was able to mount the NFS share on the remote computer.</p>
