<h1 id="problem">Problem</h1>
<p>I installed Ubuntu 14.04 on a computer with a NVIDIA GTX 590 graphics card. A few minutes after logging into Unity, the entire computer would freeze. Nothing would work, not Unity, not the mouse or keyboard and not even the Ctrl-Alt-1 terminal! This would repeat every time I powered off and powered on the computer.</p>
<h1 id="solution">Solution</h1>
<p>Looking at <code>/var/log/syslog</code> I noticed that the last error message usually involved nouveau complaining that it could not read some memory address or failed on reading a memory address. This gave me a clue that the graphics driver was not working with this particular graphics card for some reason.</p>
<p>I looked for the latest NVIDIA driver in the Ubuntu repositories, named <code>nvidia-xyz</code>, where <code>xyz</code> is the largest number you can find there and installed it. For example:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt install nvidia-331</code></pre>
<p>I restarted the computer and Ubuntu worked fine after this. This is one of those rare instances where a NVIDIA driver prevented a crash, rather than cause one! ;-)</p>
