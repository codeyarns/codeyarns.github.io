<p>Vim has an internal file explorer called <strong>NetRW</strong>. Another popular choice of file explorer for Vim is the <strong>NERDTree</strong> plugin. Recently, I started to use <strong>Ranger</strong> as my file explorer at the shell. I could open text files in it using Vim easily. However, what I really wished was to use Ranger from inside Vim as a file explorer.</p>
<p>Using Ranger inside Vim allows me to keep a Vim session with many files open and fall down to Ranger to explore and manipulate files and jump back into my Vim session. Another big advantage is that the files I open using Ranger all persist as buffers in the Vim session. That is, if I am working on File1, I jump to Ranger to find File2 and open it, then it should open back in the same Vim session, so that I now have File1 and File2 open. Thankfully, all of this is possible easily! :-)</p>
<p>To use Ranger as a file explorer for Vim, all you need to is add <a href="https://github.com/ranger/ranger/blob/master/examples/vim_file_chooser.vim">this code</a> to your Vimrc. You can then launch Ranger whenever you want by pressing your leader key and <code>r</code>. That is, usually it is <code>\r</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Tried with:</strong> Ranger 1.6.1, Vim 7.4 and Ubuntu 14.04</p>
