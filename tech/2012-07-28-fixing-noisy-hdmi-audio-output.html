<h1 class="title">Fixing noisy HDMI audio output</h1>

<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
<p>I connected a <a href="http://www.dell.com/us/en/bpi/notebooks/laptop-inspiron-1320/pd.aspx?refid=laptop-inspiron-1320"><strong>Dell Inspiron 1320</strong></a> notebook with HDMI output to a <strong>Toshiba REGZA</strong> LCD TV using a HDMI cable. The notebook is running <strong>Windows 7 Home Premium</strong>. When I play a video file on the notebook, both the audio and video from the TV seems to be fine. However, when you actually sit down to watch for a longer time you notice that the <strong>audio</strong> sounds kind of muffled or noisy and the spoken words are hard to distinguish.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>First, I suspected the TV, since it has so many audio settings in its menus. After testing all possible audio combinations on the TV, there was no improvement in the audio.</p>
<p>Then, I decided to turn to the Dell Inspiron 1320. The HDMI video and audio from this notebook is generated by its <a href="http://www.intel.com/Products/Notebook/Chipsets/GM45/GM45-overview.htm"><strong>Intel GM 45</strong></a> chipset. I used the Support section of the Intel webpage to check if any of the notebook's Intel hardware had newer drivers. And yes, there was a much newer <strong>graphics driver</strong> available. I downloaded, installed it and rebooted the notebook. When I connected the TV, the new driver could now detect that it was a Toshiba TV that was connected through HDMI and needless to say that the audio output was perfect! :-)</p>
<p><strong>Tried with:</strong> Dell Inspiron 1320 and Toshiba REGZA LCD TV</p>
