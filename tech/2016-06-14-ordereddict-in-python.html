<p><strong>Lists</strong> and <strong>dictionaries</strong> are the fundamental data structures in <strong>Python</strong>. One of the problems I regularly face with dictionary is that I cannot iterate the keys in a certain order. In many problems, I have the keys in a certain order, I am able to insert the keys in that order, but need to be able to later iterate them in that same order.</p>
<p>The solution to these exact problems is the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html"><strong>OrderedDict</strong></a>. It is just like the dictionary, but maintains the order of insertion of the keys. Later when you iterate over its keys, the order is the same as you inserted them in. I am guessing it is implemented by maintaining the keys in a list alongside a dictionary.</p>
<p>Usage of the OrderedDict is same as dictionary in all ways. The only difference is in creating it:</p>
<pre><code>import collections

d = collections.OrderedDict()</code></pre>
<p><strong>Tried with:</strong> Python 3.4</p>
