<p><img src="https://codeyarns.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/20180704_outlook_2016_dummies.jpg" alt="¬†" /> For most of my life, email was managed in either one of the free email providers (Yahoo and later Gmail) or POP/IMAP that I pulled into a simple email client. So, when I had to work with <strong>Microsoft Outlook</strong> recently, I was completely lost. Outlook when combined with <strong>Exchange</strong> is a powerful tool that handles email, calendars, meetings, tasks and notes for individuals and organizations. Quite frankly I was lost in the complex GUI of Outlook and all its features.</p>
<p>To get a quick idea of what is possible in Outlook and how to use it I turned to a familiar friend: <strong>Microsoft Outlook 2016 for Dummies</strong>. People like to ridicule the <strong>Dummies</strong> series of books, but <strong>Dan Gookin</strong> and his kind made software accessible to a lot of people like me. Dummies books, especially by veteran Dummies authors, are funny and fun to read. <strong>Bill Dyszel</strong> thankfully is no different, having been the author of all editions of the Outlook Dummies books.</p>
<p>This book covered all the important applications of Outlook 2016, only missing out on the notes feature. Earlier chapters cover the basics of using a email client, which can be skipped. Later chapters got into what I was looking for: Outlook specific features, scheduling, tasks and features related to Exchange. On the way I learnt a lot of tips and tricks which I probably would not have discovered otherwise. The only gripe I have about this book are that there are no cartoons by <strong>Rich Tennant</strong>. This is an easy and fun read full of screenshots.</p>
<p>Rating: 4 ISBN: 9781119076889</p>
<p>Some of the Outlook features I learnt from this book:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You can drag and drop anything to anywhere in the UI. For example, drag an email into the calendar icon at the bottom-right to create a calendar event.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Clean Up</strong> feature on email conversations and email folders can be used to move out emails that repeat in conversations to a specific folder. Reduces the number of emails you need to read.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Quick Steps</strong> are actions that you can create and add to the ribbon or right-click menu. For example, move to a certain folder is a builtin Quick Step.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Quick Parts</strong> can be used to reinsert repeatedly used text into emails.</p></li>
<li><p>You can create your own <strong>groups</strong> in contacts.</p></li>
<li><p>Appointments and events are different when it comes to calendars.</p></li>
<li><p>You can add <strong>holidays calendar</strong> for any country into your calendar.</p></li>
<li><p>Regenerating task is a type of task that recur after a task is completed.</p></li>
<li><p>Items of any tabular view of data can be grouped by one of the fields. Right-click on the column header and choose Group by.</p></li>
<li><p>Default categories in emails have colors and color names. These color names can be renamed to something more meaningful.</p></li>
<li><p>Merge to email can be used to create email mailers addressed to the receiver.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scheduling assistant</strong> can be used to compare schedules of attendees. <strong>Suggested times</strong> at the bottom-right shows open timeslots.</p></li>
<li><p>When responding to a meeting request, you can <strong>propose a new time</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Voting</strong> feature is similar to meeting request, but to take count from a group of people.</p></li>
<li><p>Use <strong>Tracking</strong> to check responses from folks on meeting requests and votes.</p></li>
<li><p>You can assign task to someone else.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Out of office</strong> message can be set for your vacations with a start and end date. You can have different message for folks inside and outside your organization.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>MailTips</strong> shows by colors and tooltips if any of the folks being addressed in email are on vacation.</p></li>
<li><p>Quick Access toobar can be customized by adding any function you want.</p></li>
</ul>
