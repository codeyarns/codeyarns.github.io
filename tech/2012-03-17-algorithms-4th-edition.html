<p>One of the biggest roadblocks in studying Computer Science is the
popular tome <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Algorithms"><strong>Introduction
to Algorithms</strong></a> by CLRS. It is the most common textbook for
introductory algorithms courses at universities. While it is a great
book for learning analysis of algorithms and as a reference, in my
opinion it is a horrible book to <em>learn</em> algorithms. I am pretty
sure a great many number of students have been turned off from and have
fear of algorithms since this book was their first look at algorithms.
Thankfully, there is an excellent cure for this problem.</p>
<p>I recently re-discovered the wonderful world of microprocessors with
the book <a href="2011-12-11-inside-the-machine.html"><strong>Inside the
Machine</strong></a>. It made me realize that there must be books out
there on every topic that are more intuitive, stimulating and
illustrative than the status quo. I started to look for such a book on
algorithms. After checking out almost every textbook on this topic out
there, I discovered <a
href="http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/"><strong>Algorithms</strong></a>
(4th Edition) by <strong>Robert Sedgewick</strong> and <strong>Kevin
Wayne</strong>. And, I fell in love! 😁</p>
<p>This is an introductory textbook for algorithms. The book covers all
the most important algorithms on sorting, searching, graphs and strings.
Real-world problems and historical perspectives are provided at the
beginning of every chapter to motivate the algorithm. After that a
skeleton of a Java class is sketched out with the API that is demanded
by the problem. The authors then show why other algorithms studied
earlier in the book cannot solve this problem. Using these failings as a
key, the user is introduced to a new concept that can solve the problem.
This is then advanced to the final algorithm with full working Java code
to fill out the skeleton API. Finally, many propositions about the time
and space complexity of the algorithm are put forward with their
proofs.</p>

<p>I never thought that I would find an Algorithms book so addictive
that I would study it cover to cover! What is so special about this
book? There are a few reasons for that. First are the illustrations.
There are more illustrations in this book than there are pages (yes, not
kidding!). The authors have taken great pains to tear apart the
difficulty in understanding how and why an algorithm works. And then the
code: this is the simplest, most elegant real code I have ever seen
written for algorithms. For example: do red-black trees haunt your
dreams? This book banishes that fear by elegantly using 2-3 trees and
morphing that understanding to red-black trees. And finally the proofs.
Every proposition and its intuitive proof is such a joy to work through
and finally understand that it gives one a high!</p>
<p>In my humble opinion, Algorithms (4th Edition) by Sedgewick and Wayne
is the best introduction to algorithms. There is quite simply no other
book out there that will make you fall in love with algorithms like this
one. My only advise is that you make sure you understand every
illustration and concept in the book. That goes a long way in giving you
an intuitive feel of the algorithm. If you are picking up this book, do
remember to check out the book’s <a
href="http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/">website</a>. It contains a lot of
supporting content, including <a
href="http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/">code</a> and <a
href="http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/errata/">errata</a>. (I am honored
to have been able to contribute quite a few errata to that list 😉). The
final icing on the cake is that Sedgewick and Wayne will soon be
teaching a two-part <a
href="2015-04-05-algorithms-part-1-online-course-by-sedgewick.html">Algorithms
course</a> based off this book at Coursera!</p>
