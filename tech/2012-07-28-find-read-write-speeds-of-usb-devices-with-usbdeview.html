<p>Your computer has many USB ports and you use many USB storage devices by connecting them to these ports. You might be curious about the read-write speeds of your USB storage devices with these ports. Testing these speeds is easy with the <a href="http://codeyarns.wordpress.com/2012/07/28/usbdeview/"><strong>USBDeview</strong></a> tool.</p>
<p>[caption id=&quot;attachment_2678&quot; align=&quot;aligncenter&quot; width=&quot;490&quot;][<img src="http://codeyarns.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/20120728-speedtest.png" />](http://codeyarns.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/20120728-speedtest.png) Read-write speeds of a portable hard disk.[/caption]</p>
<p>Connect your USB storage device, open USBDeview, right-click on the device, choose <strong>Speed Test</strong> and in the dialog choose Start Test. USBDeview will perform a sequential read-write test on the device over USB and report back the results.</p>
<p>Once the test is complete, you can also choose to share your speed report with everyone by publishing it automatically online. USB speeds reported by other people from their devices can be seen online <a href="http://usbspeed.nirsoft.net/">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Tried with:</strong> USBDeview 2.11 and Windows 7</p>
