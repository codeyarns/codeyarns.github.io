<p><em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Weave">Mozilla Weave</a></em>, the synchronization tool for Firefox has finally launched! I am currently using it to synchronize bookmarks and preferences between my work PC and my home laptop. (I am not putting sensitive information like passwords on the Weave servers, thank you!)</p>

<p>Installing and using Weave is pretty straightforward if you have used <em><a href="http://www.xmarks.com/">Xmarks</a></em>, which is what I currently use for bookmark synchronization. Download the <em><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/10868">Weave Sync addon</a></em> for Firefox and install it on the computers where you need synchronization. In addition to a Weave login and password, you will also be asked to create a <em>passphrase</em>, that is used to encrypt your content stored on the Weave servers. If Weave works out well for a couple of weeks, I will be saying goodbye to <em>Xmarks</em>.</p>
<p>PS: I know Google Chrome has <em><a href="http://chrome.blogspot.com/2009/11/bookmark-sync-and-more-speed-in-latest.html">bookmark synchronization</a></em> that stores the information in the user's Google Docs account. As of now, I am sticking to Firefox as I see no killer feature in Chrome that is worth the switch.</p>
