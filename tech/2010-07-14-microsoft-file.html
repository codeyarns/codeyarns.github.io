<p>This post is just for the sake of nostalgia. <strong>Microsoft
File</strong> written by <strong>Nancy Andrews</strong> is a 1986 book
about the Microsoft application of the same name for the Apple
Macintosh.</p>
<p>Before Microsoft had an operating system of its own (DOS and
Windows), it used to create applications. First came developer tools,
like Microsoft Basic and later applications. Microsoft File was one of
its earliest applications, which it created for the Apple Macintosh.
Microsoft also launched its own computer book publishing arm, called
<strong>Microsoft Press</strong>, pretty early on. Early titles from
Microsoft Press were all about the applications that Microsoft created
for the Apple Macintosh, like this one.</p>

<p>The File application was meant for business users to create, edit and
save their business documents. I was looking for the oldest Microsoft
Press books available at the university library and picked this. The
book is so old and irrelevant that it was in the <strong>Closed
Stacks</strong> section and I had to order it up. The book was too
boring to read, since the application itself is pretty boring. But, it
was worth it just to flip through the application screenshots of that
time. The author Nancy Andrews went on to write many other Microsoft
Press books about their applications of this era.</p>
