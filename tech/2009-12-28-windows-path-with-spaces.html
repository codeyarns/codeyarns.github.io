<p>Windows Vista fixed one colossal mistake Microsoft had made with
directory names. The obnoxiously named
<code>C:\Documents and Settings</code> was changed to the short and
sweet <code>C:\Users</code>. It was short, meaningful and most
importantly it did not have spaces in the path! The <code>My</code> (and
the following space) was removed from directories like
<code>My Documents</code> and they were shortened to
<code>Documents</code>, <code>Pictures</code> and
<code>Videos</code>.</p>
<p>I know it is 2009 and I should expect most real-world applications to
deal with paths that have spaces. (Sadly, a lot of open-source
applications ported over from Linux to Windows fail on this.) However, I
believe that it is of paramount importance that the default Windows
directory names themselves should be as short as possible and have no
spaces.</p>
<p>There is one elephant that remains, even in Windows 7:
<code>C:\Program Files</code></p>
<p>Strangely, there are some applications and libraries that (can deal
with paths with spaces, but) require their <em>installation path</em> to
have no spaces! Since they cannot work from
<code>C:\Program Files</code> they try to install themselves onto
<code>C:\</code> itself. This irritates me a lot, since it clutters up
that root directory! So, I resort to having another
<code>C:\Programs\</code> folder around for these applications to
install into. The famous culprits that do this are <a
href="http://www.cygwin.com/">cygwin</a>, <a
href="http://www.cgal.org/">CGAL</a> and <a
href="http://qt.nokia.com/">Qt</a>.</p>
<p>What I would like to learn from the likes of <a
href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/">Raymond Chen</a> is why
Windows 7 still uses <code>C:\Program Files</code> instead of using
something shorter like <code>C:\Programs</code>?! If they could go
through the pains of renaming <code>Documents and Settings</code> and
its bastard children, surely they could have done the same with
<code>Program Files</code>!!!</p>
