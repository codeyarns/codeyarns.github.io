<h1 class="title">Logi MX Master 3 for Business</h1>

<p>Once I started using my Dell Precision 5760 laptop, I felt the need for a full-size Bluetooth mouse. Bluetooth because I wanted to avoid dongles, especially those using USB-A on this USB-C-only laptop. I ended up selecting the <a href="https://prosupport.logi.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407009052951-Specification-MX-Master-3-for-Business"><strong>Logi MX Master 3 for Business</strong></a> mouse.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>In the box</strong>: This mouse ships in a fancy box with a <strong>Bolt</strong> receiver and a USB-A to USB-C charging cable.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Model number</strong>: M-R0077 of the mouse and C-U0021 for the receiver.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Wireless connectivity</strong>: Connecting the Bolt USB-A receiver means this is instantly recognized as a mouse by the OS. 2.4 GHz.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Bluetooth connectivity</strong>: Enable Bluetooth pairing mode in OS and power ON the mouse to add this as a Bluetooth mouse. It appears as *MX Master 3 B** in the device list. Bluetooth support is essentially the reason I selected this mouse - to avoid having to plug yet another dongle into the computer. Note that if this mouse was connected using the Bolt receiver earlier, it needs to be switched to a different computer by using the 1-2-3 button at the bottom.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Buttons and wheels</strong>: This mouse is a tactile delight with so many clicky and scrolly things on its body:</p>
<ul>
<li>Left and right buttons</li>
<li>Middle scroll wheel, which is also a middle button for clicking</li>
<li>Shift wheel mode button: Small button under the scroll wheel to toggle its scrolling speed between normal and fast.</li>
<li>Horizontal scroll wheel: On the left side for the thumb. Great for side-scrolling in spreadsheets or zooming in photos.</li>
<li>Forward and back buttons: 2 small buttons under the horizontal scroll wheel.</li>
<li>Gestures surface under the thumb region: This is hard to click, but by default shows the task view in Windows.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Battery and charging</strong>: This device charges using (any) USB-C charging cable and does not use changeable batteries. If the mouse is ON, it continues to be useable wirelessly while it is being charged. If the mouse is OFF, it can be charged, but will not function as a wired mouse. While charging the green light near the horizontal scroll wheel blinks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Software</strong>: To gain full functionality and customizations of this device I needed to download and install the <strong>Logi Options+</strong> software. All the buttons and wheels on the mouse can be configured either universally or for each specific app using this software. It ships with pre-built customizations for Chrome, Edge, Word, Excel, Powerpoint and Teams and any other application can also be added easily. If you create a Logi account, you can upload these settings to the cloud (I did not do this). The app is actually pretty nice and is the only way to update the firmware for the mouse - so this is a recommended install.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Versions</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mouse firmware: 14.0.9</li>
<li>Logi Options+: 1.24.2581</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Initial feeling: I am very happy with this mouse. It is huge, much larger than I expected and feels great in the hand. The buttons and the metal scroll wheel are all very tactile and well worth the price for a device I will use for long hours every day.</p>
