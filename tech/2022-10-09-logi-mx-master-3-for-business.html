<p>Once I started using my Dell Precision 5760 laptop, I felt the need
for a full-size Bluetooth mouse. Bluetooth because I wanted to avoid
dongles, especially those using USB-A on this USB-C-only laptop. I ended
up selecting the <a
href="https://prosupport.logi.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407009052951-Specification-MX-Master-3-for-Business"><strong>Logi
MX Master 3 for Business</strong></a> mouse.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>In the box</strong>: This mouse ships in a fancy box with
a <strong>Bolt</strong> receiver and a USB-A to USB-C charging
cable.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Model number</strong>: M-R0077 of the mouse and C-U0021
for the receiver.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Wireless connectivity</strong>: Connecting the Bolt USB-A
receiver means this is instantly recognized as a mouse by the OS. 2.4
GHz.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Bluetooth connectivity</strong>: Enable Bluetooth pairing
mode in OS and power ON the mouse to add this as a Bluetooth mouse. It
appears as <strong>MX Master 3 B</strong> in the device list. Bluetooth
support is essentially the reason I selected this mouse - to avoid
having to plug yet another dongle into the computer. Note that if this
mouse was connected using the Bolt receiver earlier and you want it to
be connected using Bluetooth now, it needs to be made to believe that it
is connecting to a different computer by using the 1-2-3 button at the
bottom of the mouse.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Buttons and wheels</strong>: This mouse is a tactile
delight with so many clicky and scrolly things on its body:</p>
<ul>
<li>Left and right buttons</li>
<li>Middle scroll wheel, which is also a middle button for clicking. Let
it spin and watch the insane number of rotations it does!</li>
<li>Shift wheel mode button: Small button under the scroll wheel to
toggle its scrolling speed between normal and fast.</li>
<li>Horizontal scroll wheel: On the left side for the thumb. Great for
side-scrolling in spreadsheets or zooming in photos.</li>
<li>Forward and back buttons: 2 small buttons under the horizontal
scroll wheel.</li>
<li>Gestures surface under the thumb region: This is hard to click, but
by default shows the task view in Windows.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Battery and charging</strong>: This device charges using
(any) USB-C charging cable and does not use changeable batteries. If the
mouse is ON, it continues to be useable wirelessly while it is being
charged. If the mouse is OFF, it can be charged, but will not function
as a wired mouse. While charging the green light near the horizontal
scroll wheel blinks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Software</strong>: To gain full functionality and
customizations of this device I needed to download and install the
<strong>Logi Options+</strong> software. All the buttons and wheels on
the mouse can be configured either universally or for each specific app
using this software. It ships with pre-built customizations for Chrome,
Edge, Word, Excel, Powerpoint and Teams and any other application can
also be added easily. If you create a Logi account, you can upload these
settings to the cloud (I did not do this). The app is actually pretty
nice and is the only way to update the firmware for the mouse - so this
is a recommended install.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Versions</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mouse firmware: 14.0.9</li>
<li>Logi Options+: 1.24.2581</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Initial feeling: I am very happy with this mouse. It is huge, much
larger than I expected and feels great in the hand. The buttons and the
metal scroll wheel are all very tactile and well worth the price for a
device I will use for long hours every day.</p>
