<li><p><a href="https://tonsky.me/blog/tahoe-icons/">It’s hard to
justify Tahoe icons</a>: Damning post on how MacOS Tahoe is overloaded
with tiny, meaningless, inconsistent UI icons. Apple seems to have
completely forgotten its own 1992 HIG.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://sqlite.org/whyc.html">Why SQLite is written in
C</a>: C is fast, compatible with all libraries and can be written in an
object-oriented manner (if required). Provides a list of requirements
for Rust before it will be considered.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://addyosmani.com/blog/21-lessons/">21 Lessons From
14 Years at Google</a>: Solid list of learnings, matched a lot with my
experience in big tech companies.</p>
<ul>
<li>The best engineers are obsessed with solving user problems.</li>
<li>Being right is cheap. Getting to right together is the real
work.</li>
<li>Bias towards action. Ship. You can edit a bad page, but you can’t
edit a blank one.</li>
<li>Clarity is seniority. Cleverness is overhead.</li>
<li>Novelty is a loan you repay in outages, hiring, and cognitive
overhead.</li>
<li>Your code doesn’t advocate for you. People do.</li>
<li>The best code is the code you never had to write.</li>
<li>At scale, even your bugs have users.</li>
<li>Most “slow” teams are actually misaligned teams.</li>
<li>Focus on what you can control. Ignore what you can’t.</li>
<li>Abstractions don’t remove complexity. They move it to the day you’re
on call.</li>
<li>Writing forces clarity. The fastest way to learn something better is
to try teaching it.</li>
<li>The work that makes other work possible is priceless - and
invisible.</li>
<li>If you win every debate, you’re probably accumulating silent
resistance.</li>
<li>When a measure becomes a target, it stops measuring.</li>
<li>Admitting what you don’t know creates more safety than pretending
you do.</li>
<li>Your network outlasts every job you’ll ever have.</li>
<li>Most performance wins come from removing work, not adding
cleverness.</li>
<li>Process exists to reduce uncertainty, not to create paper
trails.</li>
<li>Eventually, time becomes worth more than money. Act
accordingly.</li>
<li>There are no shortcuts, but there is compounding.</li>
</ul></li>

I still love the fish shell</a>: All the same reasons why I have been
using Fish as my default shell since 2013.</p></li>
