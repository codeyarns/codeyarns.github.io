<p>A couple of years ago, we wanted to upgrade to a bigger TV and ended
up getting the <a
href="https://www.sceptre.com/TV/4K-UHD-TV/U515CV-UMRD-50-4K-UHD-TV-product1173category1category73.html"><strong>Sceptre
U515CV-UMRD</strong></a>. This is a 50-inch size 4K resolution
<em>dumb</em> TV.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Requirements:</strong> What we wanted was a larger TV (50
or 55-inch) that had a 4K display. We clearly wanted the TV to be
<strong>dumb</strong>, meaning no internet connectivity, no Android TV,
no apps or complicated software. It should have at least 2 HDMI inputs
and a cable input. None of the big brands make dumb TVs anymore at this
size and resolution - so we picked the Sceptre whose price was
reasonable.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Installation:</strong> Sceptre TVs need to be ordered
through the Walmart website. Delivery took about a week and the TV box
was pretty light when opened. It just needed the legs to be attached and
it was all ready for placing on the TV stand.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Over-the-air channels:</strong> There are plenty of
over-the-air digital channels available in my place and we can watch
them for free using a flat antenna stuck to the wall. Connecting the
cable out of the antenna to the TV was easy. Change the <em>source</em>
to <em>TV</em>, make sure to choose <strong>Air</strong> (not
<em>cable</em>) and do a channel search to find your channels.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>NVIDIA Shield:</strong> We watch Netflix, Youtube and
play games using the NVIDIA Shield 2017. I connected the HDMI out of the
Shield to the TV and changing the <em>source</em> to the correct
<em>HDMI</em> in does the job. If you find Shield sleeping or not
starting without a reboot, make sure you go into its settings and
configure it to keep alive even when it detects the TV to be
off.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>DVD Player:</strong> We also use a DVD/BluRay player to
play DVDs (movies, cartoons, TV series) or CDs (music) borrowed from the
library sometimes. Again, connecting to one of the HDMI inputs and
changing <em>source</em> is all that is needed.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, this Sceptre TV is just as light, simple and dumb as I
wanted. There is no Android TV or smart TV software to mess with. The
only minor quibble is that the sound is mediocre - which is something
that can be solved with a soundbar.</p>
