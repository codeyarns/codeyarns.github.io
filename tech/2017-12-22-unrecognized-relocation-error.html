<h1 id="problem">Problem</h1>
<p>Building a large project that involved linking with many libraries, I got this linking error:</p>
<pre><code>Linking CXX shared library ../../lib/libfoobar.so
/usr/bin/ld: /somepath/opencv-2.4/lib/libopencv_imgproc.a(clahe.cpp.o): unrecognized relocation (0x2a) in section `.text._ZN12_GLOBAL__N_1L15CLAHE_Impl_infoEv&#39;
/usr/bin/ld: final link failed: Bad value</code></pre>
<h1 id="solution">Solution</h1>
<p>At first I suspected some problem with the symbol that you see the linker complaining about above. But using <strong>nm</strong> I found that the symbol was present and was defined in the archive library file.</p>
<p>Only after eliminating all other possibilities did I discover that the problem was the compiler version. The archive library file had been compiled using GCC 4.8. The linking was being done on a different computer where the compiler was GCC 5.x. The C++ ABI had changed along with the major version difference between the two compilers and this was causing the problem.</p>
<p>Once I rebuilt OpenCV with GCC 5.x and used its archive library file, the linking proceeded smoothly.</p>
