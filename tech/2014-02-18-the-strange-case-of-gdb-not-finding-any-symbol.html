<h2 id="problem">Problem</h2>
<p>I compiled C++ code using the <code>g++</code> compiler. The <code>-g</code> option was specified so that the executable had debugging information. I could run the program using <code>gdb</code> and place breakpoints and look at the source code. However, when I tried to print the value of a variable in gdb, it threw this strange error:</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) print i
No symbol &quot;i&quot; in current context</code></pre>
<p>I tried using Eclipse CDT to compile and debug the same C++ code. Again, I got a similar result. I could run in Debug mode and the program could stop at a breakpoint. However, the <strong>Variables</strong> window did not show any of the local variables. Hovering the mouse cursor over any local variable did not show its current value!</p>
<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>
<p>The culprit turned out to be a mismatch between the compiler and debugger! I had recently switched to GCC 4.8, a newer version. However, I was still using the old version of GDB. In v4.8, GCC produces debugging information in the <strong>DWARF4</strong> format, as explained in its <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.8/changes.html">release notes</a>. However, this older version of GDB could only understand DWARF3 or versions older than that. It was failing silently when local variables were requested.</p>
<p>The solution was simple: request GCC to produce debugging information in the older format by specifying <code>-gdwarf-3</code>. Once I did this, GDB could print local variables and they appeared in Eclipse CDT too.</p>
<p><strong>Tried with:</strong> GCC 4.8, GDB 7.4 and Ubuntu 12.04 LTS</p>
