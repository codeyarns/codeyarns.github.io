<p>I listen to a few <strong>podcasts</strong> regularly using a RSS feed reader. Recently, I decided to try the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fm.player&amp;hl=en"><strong>Player FM</strong></a> podcast app on Android to make this more convenient. I must say that it has turned out to be a great little app for podcasts.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Discovering my podcasts worked directly, I did not have to bother with any URL or RSS feed. Search for podcast name and add it to <strong>Subscriptions</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Latest episodes of any subscription are directly downloaded and added to a <strong>Downloads</strong> playlist by the app.</p></li>
<li><p>The app can be configured to download only over wifi, if you want that.</p></li>
<li><p>There might be times when you want to listen to a particular episode from a podcast you do not want to subscribe to. Player FM can handle that too. This can be added to your Downloads playlist too.</p></li>
<li><p>The playlist will maintain the last 10 episodes from each Subscription. Episodes which you play close to the end or to the end are automatically marked as played.</p></li>
<li><p>The app can also be configured to be offline all the time. You can make it download only when you want it to.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tried with:</strong> Player FM 2.5.4.3, Android 5.0.2 and Moto G 2nd Gen (XT1068)</p>
