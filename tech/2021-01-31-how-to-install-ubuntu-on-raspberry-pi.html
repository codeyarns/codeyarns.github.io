<p>A while ago Ubuntu <a href="https://ubuntu.com/download/raspberry-pi">added support</a> for Raspberry Pi and so recently I decided it was time to try something other than <a href="2015-01-23-how-to-install-raspbian-7.html">Raspbian</a> on my <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/"><strong>Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+</strong></a> board. Since this was an older (and thus less powerful) RPi board that I planned to use in headless mode, I chose to install <strong>Ubuntu Server</strong> instead of <strong>Ubuntu Desktop</strong>.</p>
<p>Note that Ubuntu has a <a href="https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/how-to-install-ubuntu-on-your-raspberry-pi#1-overview">guide</a> that lists the steps at a high level to install Ubuntu Server on RPi, which turned out to be not detailed enough for me to get my install working.</p>
<h2 id="install-steps-that-worked">Install steps that worked</h2>
<p>The steps that eventually worked for me are listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>I downloaded and installed the <strong>Raspberry Pi Imager for Windows</strong> from <a href="https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/imager/imager.exe">here</a>.</li>
<li>I plugged in a microSD card into my Windows computer. The Ubuntu guide lists 4GB as sufficient and 8GB as recommended. I initially used a 4GB microSD card that was quite slow, so I switched to a fast <strong>64GB microSD card</strong> for my final install. Since my Windows computer does not have a microSD card reader slot, I used a <a href="https://www.anker.com/products/variant/anker-2in1-usb-c-to-sdmicro-sd-card-reader/A83700A2"><strong>Anker USB-C 2-in-1 SD card reader</strong></a> which worked out ok.</li>
<li>In the Imager, I chose <strong>Ubuntu Server 20.04.1 LTS 64-bit</strong> to install on the microSD card. The Imager pulls the image from the web to install the first time, so the <em>writing</em> step can be slow. The OS image is cached locally, so if you repeat the same install the writing step will be fast. After writing, the Imager also does a <em>verifying</em> step to ensure the install was done correctly.</li>
<li>I ejected the microSD card from my Windows computer and reinserted it. I created an empty file named <code>ssh</code> on the card. This enables SSH access to the RPi board on its first boot.</li>
<li>I ejected the microSD card from my Windows computer and inserted it into my RPi board. I connected the RPi board to my home wireless router using a LAN cable. I finally connected the RPi board to power using a <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/1995"><strong>Adafruit 5V 2.5A microUSB power supply</strong></a>.</li>
<li>I left the RPi to boot Ubuntu for the first time and finish its initialization. After 10 minutes (after the blinking green light had settled into a slow steady blink), I unplugged and plugged back the power to <strong>reboot</strong> the RPi.</li>
<li>I opened up my wireless router‚Äôs web interface and noticed that my RPi board had been assigned an IP address. I had a refresh my router‚Äôs interface a few times and waited 5-10 minutes for this change.</li>
<li>I opened WSL on my Windows computer and tried my first SSH login to the RPi board <code>ssh ubuntu@&lt;IP address&gt;</code>. The initial password is <code>ubuntu</code>. Ubuntu immediately asks you to change your password for the <code>ubuntu</code> user.</li>
<li>After this I was able to SSH to the RPi normally. I did a <code>sudo apt update ; sudo apt upgrade</code> to update the packages.</li>
</ul>
<p>I now had a working Ubuntu running on a ARM64 CPU. üôÇ</p>
<h2 id="what-did-not-work">What did not work</h2>
<p>Initially, I tried to bring up the RPi board using wifi. This involved modifying the <code>network-config</code> file on the microSD card from Windows and adding the network name and password. Once the RPi board had finished one reboot, I could see its wifi IP address in my wireless router‚Äôs interface. But SSH to this IP address would hang indefinitely. I tried this many times, with both Ubuntu Server 20.04.1 64-bit and 32-bit installs, and only once did I get to the Ubuntu change-default-password stage and then the interface went off. Not sure what the problem here is, probably something to do with the wifi driver. So eventually, I switched to using a ethernet LAN cable and the bring up worked as described above.</p>
