<h1 class="title">How to install Ubuntu on Raspberry Pi</h1>

<p>A while ago Ubuntu added support for Raspberry Pi and so recently I decided it was time to try something other than Raspbian on my <strong>Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+</strong> board. Since this was an older (and thus less powerful) RPi board, I chose to install <strong>Ubuntu Server</strong> instead of <strong>Ubuntu Desktop</strong> which needs more resources.</p>
<p>Note that Ubuntu has a <a href="https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/how-to-install-ubuntu-on-your-raspberry-pi#1-overview">guide</a> that lists the steps at a high level to install Ubuntu Server on RPi, which turned out to be not detailed enough for me to get my install working. The steps that eventually worked for me are listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>I downloaded and installed the <strong>Raspberry Pi Imager for Windows</strong> from <a href="https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/imager/imager.exe">here</a>.</li>
<li>I plugged in a microSD card into my Windows computer. The Ubuntu guide lists 4GB as sufficient and 8GB as recommended. I initially used an 4GB microSD card that was quite slow, so I switched to a fast 64GB microSD card for my final install. Since my Windows computer does not have a microSD card reader slot, I used a <strong>Anker USB-C 2-in-1 SD card reader</strong> which worked out ok.</li>
<li>In the Imager, I chose <strong>Ubuntu Server 20.04.1 LTS 64-bit</strong> to install on the microSD card. The Imager pulls the image from the web to install the first time, so the <em>writing</em> step can be slow. The OS image is cached locally, so if you do the same install again the writing step will be fast. After writing, the Imager also does a <em>verifying</em> step to ensure the install was done correctly.</li>
<li>I ejected the microSD card from my Windows computer and reinserted it. I created an empty file named <code>ssh</code> on the card. This enables SSH access to the RPi board on its first boot.</li>
<li>I ejected the microSD card from my Windows computer and inserted it into my RPi board. I connected the RPi board to my home wireless router using a LAN cable. I finally connected the RPi board to power using a <strong>Adafruit 5V 2.5A microUSB</strong> cable.</li>
<li>I left the RPi to boot Ubuntu for the first time and finish its initialization. After 10 minutes (after the blinking green light had settled into a slow steady blink), I unplugged and plugged back the power to <strong>reboot</strong> the RPi.</li>
<li>I opened up my wireless router’s web interface and noticed that my RPi board had been assigned an IP address. I had a refresh my router’s interface a few times and waited 5-10 minutes for this change.</li>
<li>I opened WSL on my Windows computer and tried my first SSH login to the RPi board <code>ssh ubuntu@&lt;IP address&gt;</code>. The initial password is <code>ubuntu</code>. Ubuntu immediately asks you to change your password for the <code>ubuntu</code> user.</li>
<li>After this I was able to SSH to the RPi normally. I did a <code>sudo apt update ; sudo apt upgrade</code> to update the packages.</li>
</ul>
<p>I now had a working Ubuntu running on a ARM64 CPU now. 🙂</p>
