<p>A while ago Ubuntu <a href="https://ubuntu.com/download/raspberry-pi">added support</a> for Raspberry Pi and so recently I decided it was time to try something other than <a href="2015-01-23-how-to-install-raspbian-7.html">Raspbian</a> on my <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/"><strong>Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+</strong></a> board. Since this was an older (and thus less powerful) RPi board that I planned to use in headless mode, I chose to install <strong>Ubuntu Server</strong> instead of <strong>Ubuntu Desktop</strong>.</p>
<p>Note that Ubuntu has a <a href="https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/how-to-install-ubuntu-on-your-raspberry-pi#1-overview">guide</a> that lists the steps at a high level to install Ubuntu Server on RPi, which turned out to be not detailed enough for me to get my install working.</p>
<h2 id="install-steps-that-worked">Install steps that worked</h2>
<p>The steps that eventually worked for me are listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download and install the <strong>Raspberry Pi Imager for Windows</strong> from <a href="https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/imager/imager.exe">here</a>.</li>
<li>Plug in a microSD card into a Windows computer. The Ubuntu guide lists 4GB as sufficient and 8GB as recommended. I initially used a 4GB microSD card that was quite slow, so I switched to a fast <strong>64GB microSD card</strong> for my final install. (Learn more about SD card speeds <a href="2021-02-01-sd-card-specifications.html">here</a>.) Since my Windows computer does not have a microSD card reader slot, I used a <a href="https://www.anker.com/products/variant/anker-2in1-usb-c-to-sdmicro-sd-card-reader/A83700A2"><strong>Anker USB-C 2-in-1 SD card reader</strong></a> which worked out ok.</li>
<li>In the Imager, choose the OS you want and the SD card drive to install it to. I chose <strong>Ubuntu Server 20.04.1 LTS 64-bit</strong> to install on my microSD card. The Imager pulls the image from the web to install the first time, so the <em>writing</em> step can be slow. The OS image is cached locally, so if you repeat the same install the writing step will be fast. After writing, the Imager also does a <em>verifying</em> step to ensure the install was done correctly.</li>
<li>Eject the microSD card from the computer and reinsert it. Create an empty file named <code>ssh</code> on the card - this enables SSH access to the RPi board on its first boot.</li>
<li>Eject the microSD card from the Windows computer and insert it into the RPi board. Connect the RPi board to your home wireless router using a LAN cable. Finally connect the RPi board to power. I used a <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/1995"><strong>Adafruit 5V 2.5A microUSB power supply</strong></a> for this.</li>
<li>Give the RPi a few minutes to finish its first boot up and setup. Open up your wireless router‚Äôs web interface and look for a new <strong>wired connection</strong>. This is your RPi board, note down its IP address.</li>
<li>SSH to the RPi board from the Windows computer using <code>ssh ubuntu@&lt;IP address&gt;</code> and the password is <code>ubuntu</code>. I used WSL to do this.</li>
<li>After this, SSH to the RPi should work normally. To start things off on a good footing, I ended the install with a <code>sudo apt update ; sudo apt upgrade ; sudo reboot</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You now have the entire universe of Ubuntu packages and tools accessible from a ARM64 computer. üôÇ</p>
<h2 id="what-did-not-work-install-from-wifi">What did not work: Install from wifi</h2>
<p>Initially, I tried to bring up the RPi board using wifi. This involved modifying the <code>network-config</code> file on the microSD card from Windows and adding the network name and password. Once the RPi board had finished one reboot, I could see its wifi IP address in my wireless router‚Äôs interface. But SSH to this IP address would hang indefinitely. I tried this many times, with both Ubuntu Server 20.04.1 64-bit and 32-bit installs, and only once did I get to the Ubuntu change-default-password stage and then the interface went off. Not sure what the problem here is, probably something to do with the wifi driver. So eventually, I switched to using a ethernet LAN cable and the bring up worked as described above.</p>
