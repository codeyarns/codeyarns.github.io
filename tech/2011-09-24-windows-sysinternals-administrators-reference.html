<p>I have been a huge fan of the <a
href="http://www.sysinternals.com/"><strong>Sysinternals</strong></a>
tools ever since I switched to Windows for my work. These tools give the
ability to peek into every heartbeat of Windows, and you develop an
appreciation for the beauty and complexity of this operating system. So,
it is no wonder that I eagerly awaited the <strong>Windows Sysinternals
Administrator’s Reference</strong> once <a
href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/markrussinovich/"><strong>Mark
Russinovich</strong></a> announced it earlier this year. Written by Mark
and <strong>Aaron Margosis</strong>, this book helps readers use the
Sysinternals tools effectively to understand the working internals of
Windows, and to diagnose and fix problems.</p>
<p>Part 1 talks about the history of Sysinternals tools and gives a
brief description of administrator privileges, user-kernel mode,
processes, threads, jobs and handles in Windows. Though designed similar
to other operating systems, Windows is a different beast. This chapter
is a highly educational read to understand just how it differs and to
catch up on the Windows OS jargon. The first 3 chapters of Part 2 are
worth the price of the book itself – they go deep into the capabilities
of <strong>Process Explorer</strong>, <strong>Process Monitor</strong>
and <strong>Autoruns</strong>. Having learnt these 3 tools one can start
to live comfortably with Windows. (Well, almost!) The rest of Part 2
covers the other Sysinternals tools, most of which I do not use. Part 3
is a compendium of many troubleshooting mystery cases, which were solved
by using Sysinternals tools. Followers of Russinovich’s blog or talks
will be familiar with most of these since he has written and presented
about them before. Written like a detective mystery, each of these are
sure to be engaging to geeks.</p>
<p>Windows Sysinternals Administrator’s Reference is a good companion to
the Windows Internals books, providing the much needed practical
information and tools to get down-and-dirty with the internals of
Windows. Like his blog and talks, Russinovich’s narrative here is
entertaining and educational to read. The book completely pays for
itself with just Part 1 and the first 3 chapters of Part 2. This book is
a must for everyone who uses Windows as their primary operating
system.</p>
