<p>If you use both Linux and Windows on the same computer, you might sometimes want to access files from the Linux partition on Windows. Usually, the partition is formatted as Ext2 or Ext3. If this is the case, then you can access them using <a href="http://www.ext2fsd.com/">Ext2Fsd</a>.</p>
<p>Use the installer file from the website to install it.</p>
<p>To mount a partition, open the Ext2 Volume Manager. This shows a list of all the partitions on the computer. Your Ext2 or Ext3 partition must be visible here. To mount a partition, right-click it, choose Ext2 Management. In the dialog, in the section Mount Point and Drive Letter, enable Automatically mount via Ext2Mgr and in the dropdown choose a drive letter. Click Apply and the partition will be mounted at that drive letter. You now have read-only access to the contents of that partition at that drive letter.</p>
<p><strong>Tried with:</strong> Ext2Fsd 0.52 and Windows 7 x64</p>
