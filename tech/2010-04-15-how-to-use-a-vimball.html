<p>I noticed that <strong>plugins</strong> of <strong>ViM</strong> have now started to ship as vimballs. A <strong>vimball</strong> is a ViM-readable archive format that holds the plugin files and commands to install them. A plugin downloaded as a Vimball typically has a file extension of <strong>.vba</strong> or <strong>.vimball</strong>, say <code>Foobar.vba</code>.</p>
<p>To <strong>view</strong> the plugin files installed by a vimball and their destination directories, open <code>Foobar.vba</code> in ViM and use:</p>
<pre><code>:VimballList</code></pre>
<p>A Vimball can be <strong>installed</strong> with a single command. Open <code>Foobar.vba</code> in ViM and invoke:</p>
<pre><code>:source %</code></pre>
<p><strong>%</strong> is a ViM read-only <strong><a href="http://codeyarns.wordpress.com/2010/04/15/vim-registers/">register</a></strong> that holds the name of the currently open file. <strong>:source</strong> executes Ex commands from its source, which is %, the vimball file in this case.</p>
<p>To <strong>view</strong> the currently loaded plugins, use:</p>
<pre><code>:scriptnames</code></pre>
<p>This lists all the loaded .vim plugin files with their complete path. The plugin installed from the vimball should also be listed in this output.</p>
<p>To <strong>remove</strong> a plugin which was installed from a Vimball use:</p>
<pre><code>:RmVimball Foobar</code></pre>
<p>The ability of ViM to read and execute vimballs is through a plugin called vimball. A default install of ViM should already have this plugin loaded.</p>
