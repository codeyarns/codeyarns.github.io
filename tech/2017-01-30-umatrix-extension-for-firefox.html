<p><strong>uMatrix</strong> is a Firefox extension that can be used to
control exactly what network requests are made by the browser and thus
what is loaded in the requested webpage. It is of similar use as
ad-blockers (like AdBlock) or script blockers (NoScript) or other
blockers like uBlock. But, uMatrix is more fine-grained and a bit more
complicated but gives you a lot more idea of what a webpage is trying to
load and if you would want to allow that. uMatrix is a fork and
improvement over an earlier addon called <a
href="https://github.com/gorhill/httpswitchboard/"><strong>HTTP
Switchboard</strong></a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Install:</strong> It can be installed from <a
href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/umatrix/">here</a>.
No browser restart is required. You will find its icon added to the
toolbar.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Settings:</strong> Before you try anything, head over to
its <a href="//umatrix/content/dashboard.html">dashboard</a>. In the
<strong>Privacy</strong> tab, you can turn off the feature of clearing
browser cache every 60 minutes. The <strong>My rules</strong> tab is
where you can find the list of rules that are applied by uMatrix to
decide if a network request on a webpage should be allowed or not. You
will find the default rules that uMatrix starts off with under
<strong>Permanent Rules</strong> and the rules that you have set under
<strong>Temporary Rules</strong>. Do not worry if it looks complicated
cause you usually set these rules using the colorful 2D matrix (or
switchboard) UI of uMatrix. In the <strong>Hosts files</strong> tab,
click the Update Now button to update all the hostnames to block from
the various popular lists maintained on the internet.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Content is blocked by default:</strong> By default,
uMatrix blocks all types of content from the blocked hostnames (see
above) and allows CSS and image content only from the domain you are
visiting. Many websites may not render or work correctly due to this and
you will need to step in to tell uMatrix to allow other content from
other domains. This default behavior is called <strong>Block All / Allow
Exceptionally</strong>. To allow everything by default is called
<strong>Allow All / Block Exceptionally</strong>. You can find detailed
information about these two modes <a
href="https://github.com/gorhill/httpswitchboard/wiki/How-to-use-HTTP-Switchboard:-Two-opposing-views">here</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Control content:</strong> On any webpage, click the
uMatrix icon in the toolbar to reveal the 2D matrix where you can click
to enable or disable loading from particular hostnames (the rows) or
loading particular types of content (the columns). Red color means
disabled and green means enabled. Clicking upper part of a cell enables
and lower part disables. Clicking rows or columns should usually be
enough, if you want finer control you can click the cells, that is
controlling a particular content from a particular hostname. Click the
Refresh icon to re-render the webpage with these changes. The rules you
set here are the rules you can see in the Dashboard (see
above).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Whitelist a domain:</strong> The top-left cell is the Z
axis to this 2D matrix. Clicking it you can choose if you want to set
rules for every page (asterisk) or this particular hostname. For
example, if I enable instapaper.com in the every page (asterisk)
section, then content coming from instapaper.com will be allowed no
matter which website I visit.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Undo or Save:</strong> Click the Lock icon to save the
rules for this webpage. Click the Eraser icon to revert back to last
saved rules for this webpage.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Persist settings:</strong> By default, the rules you
painstakingly set for websites will persist only in a Firefox session.
They will be forgotten if you restart Firefox. To make them persist, go
to the Dashboard → My Rules section and move the rules from Temporary
Rules to Permanent Rules section.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Default rules:</strong> As a reference, when uMatrix is
installed freshly, it starts off with these rules (<a
