<p>I am happy to note that this blog has now crossed <strong>4 million views</strong>! It crossed <strong>3 million</strong> just over <a href="https://codeyarns.com/2015/08/30/3-million-views-and-a-rename/">a year ago</a>. Almost all the traffic comes from Google. There are close to 2000 posts and the traffic is spread over a long tail of posts.</p>

<p>When the blog crossed 3 million views, I also renamed it from <strong>ChooruCode.com</strong> to <strong>CodeYarns.com</strong>. Though it seemed sensible at that time, in hindsight it turned out to be a bad idea. Google immediately cut traffic in half after the rename and it never recovered from that. Other than that halving of traffic, month-on-month traffic is pretty stable as seen in the above plot.</p>

<p>These days I mostly use my Twitter account <span class="citation">[@daariga]</span>(http://twitter.com/daariga) to both consume and share. I have to admit that after Twitter there is very little energy left to write blog posts! Also, family and work are increasingly bigger consumers of my time, not that I am complaining. I next look forward to seeing how long it takes to cross the big 5 million :-)</p>
