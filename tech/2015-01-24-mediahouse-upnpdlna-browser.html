<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dbapp.android.mediahouse&amp;hl=en"><strong>MediaHouse UPnP/DLNA Browser</strong></a> is a UPnP/DLNA server and client for Android. It can both serve the content on your Android device to your home network or receive media streams from a UPnP/DLNA server on your home network.</p>
<p>I found the UI to be straightforward and convenient compared to the complicated UI of other such apps. Videos can be played through an external player. Thankfully, music files in a folder can be queued up to play in ordered or shuffled mode. Just long-press the folder to get the menu where you can do this.</p>
<p>The free version has a small restriction though: the number of music files that can be added to playlist is limited.</p>
<p><strong>Tried with:</strong> MediaHouse UPnP/DLNA Browser 1.5.0, Android 5.0.2 and Nexus 7 (2013)</p>
