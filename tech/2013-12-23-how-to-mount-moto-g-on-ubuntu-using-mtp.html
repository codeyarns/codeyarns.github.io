<p><strong>Moto G</strong> is an Android smartphone that does not have a microSD slot. So, the storage of the smartphone cannot be extended. If you want to transfer files between your Ubuntu computer and the Moto G, there are 3 possible ways to do that: FTP over wireless, <strong>PTP</strong> over USB and <strong>MTP</strong> over USB.</p>
<p>If your Ubuntu computer has wireless, I highly recommend using <a href="2012/12/29/ftpserver-app-for-android/">FTP over wireless</a>. It is convenient (no wires!), offers good transfer speed and the entire <code>/sdcard</code> contents are available for read and write.</p>
<p>If your Ubuntu computer does not have wireless, then your next option is to use a micro-USB-to-USB cable. The choices here are PTP and MTP. You can enable and switch between the two after you connect Moto G to your computer using a USB cable. If you enable PTP, then Moto G is automatically mounted as a partition in Nautilus. However, you will only be able to see the <code>/sdcard/DCIM</code> and <code>/sdcard/Pictures</code> directories. If you are transferring photos, then this option offers good transfer speed.</p>
<p>If your Ubuntu computer does not have wireless and you still want to read and write to the contents of <code>/sdcard</code> then the option left to you is MTP. Note that with MTP, Moto G takes a really long time to mount and the transfer speeds are really really low. It can take ages to transfer even a small file. You have been warned! :-)</p>
<p>There are many solutions offered online to mount the contents of <code>/sdcard</code> using MTP. <a href="http://askubuntu.com/questions/207569">This solution</a> is the only one that worked for me:</p>
<ul>
<li>Install the MTP packages:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>$ sudo apt-get install mtp-tools mtpfs</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><p>Connect Moto G using a USB cable to your computer. Make sure MTP is selected, and not PTP.</p></li>
<li><p>Find out the vendor ID and product ID of Moto G using <code>mtp-detect</code>. For my smartphone I got:</p></li>
</ul>
<pre><code>$ sudo mtp-detect
Unable to open ~/.mtpz-data for reading, MTPZ disabled.libmtp version: 1.1.3

Listing raw device(s)
Device 0 (VID=22b8 and PID=2e82) is UNKNOWN.
Please report this VID/PID and the device model to the libmtp development team
   Found 1 device(s):
   22b8:2e82 @ bus 1, dev 12
Attempting to connect device(s)
Android device detected, assigning default bug flags</code></pre>
<p>You need to press <code>Ctrl+C</code> to stop the command. For the Moto G, you can see that the vendor ID is <code>22b8</code> and product ID is <code>2e82</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Open a new file <code>/etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules</code> using <code>sudo</code> and add this line:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>SUBSYSTEM==&quot;usb&quot;, ATTR{idVendor}==&quot;22b8&quot;, ATTR{idProduct}==&quot;2e82&quot;, MODE=&quot;0666&quot;</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Restart the USB service and create a directory to mount the Moto G:</li>
</ul>
<p>[code lang=bash] $ sudo service udev restart $ sudo mkdir /media/motog $ sudo chmod a+rwx /media/motog $ sudo adduser your-user-name fuse</p>
<pre><code>


  * Open the `/etc/fuse.conf` file as `sudo` and uncomment the line for `user_allow_other`



  * Restart your computer. Connect back the Moto G to the computer.



  * You can now mount the `/sdcard` of your Moto G using this command:



</code></pre>
<p>$ mtpfs -o allow_other /media/motog/</p>
<pre><code>


Note that the mounting operation is slow and might take about a minute.





  * You can find all the directories and files in `/sdcard` of Moto G in `/media/motog`. You can read and write to these directories.



  * To unmount use this command:



</code></pre>
<p>$ fusermount -u /media/motog/ ```</p>
<p>That is it! You may want to create aliases for the mount and unmount command to make it easy to use :-)</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You will not get the USB mass storage option in Moto G since that can be provided for external storage, not for partitions from which the Linux kernel is currently running. And in any case, you will need root access on the phone to touch those directories.</p>
<p><strong>Tried with:</strong> Moto G and Ubuntu 12.04</p>
