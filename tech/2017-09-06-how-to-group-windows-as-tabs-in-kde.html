<p><strong>KDE/Plasma/KWin</strong> 4.x that ships in <strong>Ubuntu 14.04</strong> has one amazing feature that I discovered today. I keep many XTerm, RXVT and related file explorer windows open. These were related to many servers I was SSHed to and I was looking for a way to group windows related to each server together. Guess what, KDE 4.x has a fantastic solution!</p>
<p>KDE 4.x allows you to <strong>group</strong> any set of open application windows together as <strong>tabs</strong>. Just right-click on the titlebar of an application and choose <strong>Attach as tab</strong> and pick the other application with which you want to group this one. These two application windows will now appear in a single window as tabs! You can repeat this operation and group together apps as tabs inside super-windows. (In older KDE, this option appears as <strong>Move window to group</strong>.) This works for any application window, they can be from different applications. What a great way to organize your windows on the desktop!</p>
<p>Sadly, this feature is missing in the recent KDE/Plasma/KWin 5.x series that ships in Ubuntu 16.04. It lies on the <a href="https://community.kde.org/Plasma/5.10_Errata">missing features</a> list and I really hope they will reimplement this great feature.</p>
