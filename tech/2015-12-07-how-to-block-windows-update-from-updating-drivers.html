<p>Controlling what is updated in <strong>Windows Update</strong> has gotten harder in <strong>Windows 10</strong>. Drivers for your hardware are automatically installed when you update Windows now. In earlier Windows, you got a chance to cherry pick the updates and mark some updates to never be done. Those choices are gone now! (You can uninstall an update. That is not a great solution when your driver update has made it impossible for your Windows to boot!)</p>
<p>Automatic driver update is a good feature for almost everyone, except those who have <strong>NVIDIA graphics cards</strong>. Graphics drivers are notorious for being buggy. You almost <strong>never</strong> want to get the driver from Windows Update for your NVIDIA graphics card. You should always get it from the NVIDIA website itself.</p>
<p>There is a solution to this: block Windows 10 from installing drivers when it does Windows Update.</p>
<p>To do this, open Control Panel and go to System -&gt; Advanced System Settings -&gt; Hardware -&gt; Device Installation Settings. Here choose to never update drivers through Windows Update.</p>
