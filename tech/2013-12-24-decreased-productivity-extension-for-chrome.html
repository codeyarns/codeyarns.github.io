<p>Open plan offices are getting popular at workplaces now. One problem of this setup is that almost any webpage you open looks distracting to someone passing by. Even technical webpages have bright colors, huge photos and advertisements.</p>
<p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/decreased-productivity/nlbpiflhmdcklcbihngeffpmoklbiooj/"><strong>Decreased Productivity</strong></a> is a great <strong>Chrome</strong> extension for browsing in such a work environment. It removes all the colors and photos from a webpage showing it as simple black text on white background. It has lots of settings where you can choose how it should hide the webpage content and which elements to hide. To get started, just install the extension and click the <strong>coffee cup</strong> icon it adds to the addressbar.</p>
<p><strong>Tried with:</strong> Decreased Productivity 0.46.34 and Chrome 31.0.1650.63</p>
