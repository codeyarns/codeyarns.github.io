<h1 id="problem">Problem</h1>
<p>I had to extend a <strong>Windows</strong> partition on a <strong>Dell Inspiron 1320</strong> notebook. So, I booted the computer with a <strong>Ubuntu</strong> USB disk. To extend the partition, I opened <strong>GParted</strong>. However, it was stuck at <code>Searching /dev/sda partitions</code>. This task did not finish even though I left the computer for many hours!</p>
<h1 id="solution">Solution</h1>
<p>It turns out that this a common problem on Dell notebooks, as reported in detail <a href="http://gparted-forum.surf4.info/viewtopic.php?id=16892">here</a>. The culprit is the tiny partition that Dell puts at the beginning of the disk. On my notebook this partition appears in Windows as <strong>OEM Partition</strong>. I cannot mount, umount, change or delete it from Windows! I could not find any solution online that describes how to do this either.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> I was able to extend the Windows partition though. Turns out it can be done easily from Administrative Tools -&gt; Computer Management -&gt; Disk Management. I was actually surprised it allowed me to extend a live mounted partition. But it does it in a snap!</p>
