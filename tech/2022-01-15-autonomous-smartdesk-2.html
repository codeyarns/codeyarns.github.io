<h1 class="title">Autonomous SmartDesk 2</h1>

<p>In 2020, when I started working from home (due to COVID) one of the first nice things I missed from office was my standing desk there. I looked at the various desks available at that time and ordered the <a href="https://www.autonomous.ai/standing-desks"><strong>Autonomous SmartDesk 2</strong></a>. (The product has been discontinued and replaced with other similar products now.) I have been using it every single day all day for the past 2 years and I am quite happy with it.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Requirements:</strong> To fit my ergonomic needs, I wanted a desk that went down to a height of <strong>25.5</strong> inches or below. Every other desk in the market at that time went down only to <strong>27</strong> inches. I soon found out that this was to cut costs and reduce complexity - for a smaller height range, desks can use 2 telescoping elements instead of 3.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cost:</strong> Autonomous had a big discount going at that time, and I was able to order this for about $500. It was a bit higher than other desks, but I later found that this was well worth the cost. The desk is really well designed and is a beast - real-wood surface and sturdy legs and base.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Delivery:</strong> It turns out that Autonomous was based in CA, so the desk was delivered within a week. The heavy package took some huffing and puffing to move into the bedroom.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Assembly and disassembly:</strong> Putting together the desk took close to 2 hours. This was mostly because the parts are quite heavy and I needed to be careful not to hurt myself or damage the floor or walls. I have moved twice with this desk and thankfully I was able to avoid disassembling this desk. The doors at all places just about fit the width of this desk and I had movers who moved it. If you need to move in the future and would be doing it on your own, please think about getting a much lighter, smaller desk that is easier to disassemble.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Top and frame:</strong> All the tops in this model are a solid 1-inch thick. This may not seem like much, but note that the tops in this model are all solid-wood! And I had ordered <strong>walnut</strong>, which turned out to be an exceptionally heavy and sturdy top. The legs had 3 telescoping parts - other models and desks which don‚Äôt have the height range of this one use 2 telescoping parts. All the legs and base were heavy and tough.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Heights:</strong> This model has a height range of 25.2-51 inches. There are 4 height buttons that can be programmed and the Up/Down buttons can also be used to customize the height at any time. I like this because this enables 2 people (or even 3) in the home to use the desk with their own height settings.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Experience:</strong> In 2 years, I have found that this desk has been my daily companion without any complaints. The motors have worked flawlessly and the 1-inch real-wood surface takes any load. The heavy base and legs have never wobbled even a bit. The walnut surface is dark brown in color - which turned out to be great for a room with good sunlight. But in a room with less sunlight, I think a white or light brown surface is better. The latter also shows dust less.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, I think this desk really feels like a modern luxury standing desk, something that is really worth the money if you work from home daily. It is one of the few desks that comes down to a low height - a must-have feature for folks who are of modest height (like me).</p>
<p>If you need to move occasionally, I recommend getting a lighter and smaller desk than this one, made of particle board top and easier to disassemble.</p>
