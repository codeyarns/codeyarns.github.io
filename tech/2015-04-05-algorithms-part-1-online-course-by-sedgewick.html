<p>The <a
href="https://www.coursera.org/course/algs4partI"><strong>Algorithms
(Part 1)</strong></a> online course at <strong>Coursera</strong> taught
by <strong>Sedgewick</strong> had been on my radar since I discovered
his fantastic <a
href="2012-03-17-algorithms-4th-edition.html"><strong>Algorithms (4th
Edition)</strong> textbook</a>. This course is offered every few months
and I had enrolled once before in it, only to drop out due to laziness.
This second time I joined it a month late, but was able to finish within
the hard deadline time.</p>
<p>This course is a must if you liked Sedgewick’s Algorithms book. I
loved this textbook for the intuitive explanations of the algorithms and
their complexity, the elegant Java code and what is easily the best
illustrations of algorithms and data structures I have seen so far.
However, as I self-studied this textbook, I did not do any exercises or
program any assignments. This is where Sedgewick’s online courses
beautifully complement the book.</p>
<p>The course consists of lectures, exercises and assignments. Since I
had studied the textbook and Sedgewick speaks pretty slowly, I was able
to breeze through the <strong>lectures</strong> at a 1.5x speed. It acts
as an excellent revision of the material in the textbook. Also note that
there are lectures on some topics that are <strong>not in the
textbook</strong>. For example, the geometric applications of BSTs.
Another advantage of the lecture videos, is that you can see the
algorithms in action in beautiful animations. These are many times
better than viewing static illustrations in a book. This is especially
true for operations on trees.</p>
<p>The hard work in the course is in the exercises and assignments, both
of which are graded by online programs. Problems in a typical
<strong>exercise</strong> will present the input values to an algorithm
or values in the middle of the operation of an algorithm. Using pencil
and paper you need to work out something interesting about this input. I
found this working out of sorting or trees on paper to be extremely
illuminating. It adds on another dimension to your understanding of the
algorithm. The <strong>assignments</strong> in this course are no
pushover. Each can take anywhere from a day to two days to finish and
get full score. In each assignment, a full blown problem is presented
where you will need to design a new algorithm to solve the problem. The
online score keeper is beautifully designed to take you from simple
brute-force solutions to the final solution that is optimal in time and
space. You will be expected to discover new algorithms and techniques to
solve these interesting problems.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I have been extremely satisfied with the Algorithms
(Part 1) course by Sedgewick. Working through the course has added new
dimensions to my understanding of these fundamental algorithms. The
Algorithms course in my undergrad was badly taught, its tests and
assignments very superficial and my self-study of textbooks did not
involve exercises or assignments. With this course I think I have now
gained a good understanding of this beautiful topic. The logical next
step is the Algorithms (Part 2) course, which I plan to take sometime
soon.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/4</p>
